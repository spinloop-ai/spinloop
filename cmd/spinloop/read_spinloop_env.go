// The Spinloop a read verb may be given. It selects nothing — the target comes
// from --env or --fleet — and is read only for the environment it carries: its
// ENV instructions and the .env beside it, applied before any control-plane or
// daemon work. That is what lets AWS credentials, a profile, or the
// SPINLOOP_REMOTE_* overrides live in a project's Spinloop rather than in the
// shell that happens to be running the command.
//
// The `remote` subcommands this replaces also consulted ./Spinloop when none
// was named. The verbs do not: a file sitting in the working directory should
// not silently set environment variables for a command that reads a fleet, and
// naming it is one flag. Nothing else about the rule changes.

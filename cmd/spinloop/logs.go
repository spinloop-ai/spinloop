the fleet.yaml in the working directory. --fleet has no -f here: that is
--follow's short form, and a flag cannot carry two meanings on one command
line.

cloud environment's can — a daemon's log is one file on one machine, where
none of the three narrows anything — so a node that cannot be narrowed is
read as it would be without them.`,

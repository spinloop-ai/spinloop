		Use:   "dashboard",
		Short: "watch the engines in an interactive tiled view",
		Long: `An interactive live view of the target: a tile per node, each drawing
what the gauge format of fleet metrics prints — state, what it serves, the
resource gauges, the token counters — repainted on an interval. A single
registered environment (--env) opens as a board of one.

The view is read-only apart from four keys: s starts the selected node, k
keeps a remote environment for a duration you type — it asks how long,
pre-filled with 4h, and reports the deadline the control plane set when the
keep is done — a abandons a start still in flight on it (the wait ends, the
node is free again — a wake the cloud is carrying goes on), x stops it after
a confirmation. The arrow keys move the selection, r forces a refresh, q or
Ctrl+C leaves. The keep key shows only for a node that can be kept — a remote
environment — and a kept environment's tile and detail view carry its
deadline beside the last-active line, whatever the engine's state.

A node that cannot be reached is still a tile, showing why, and a node whose
token reference is unresolvable holds its reason for the life of the view.
The board needs a terminal; to stream the metrics into a pipe, use fleet
metrics --watch instead.`,

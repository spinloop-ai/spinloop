// because the command has to decide, token by token, which arguments are
// spinloop's own and which belong to the launched harness: a leading positional
// that names a Spinloop is consumed, a `--` opts out, and everything after the
// hand-off point forwards byte-for-byte. The flags are registered on the
// command's own flag set — the body parses that set, and the completion surface
// reads the same one, so parsing and completion cannot drift apart. Because both
// spellings come from this single builder they share flags, Spinloop
// application, and launch, and cannot drift from each other.

// Shared status rendering. Both `spinloop remote status` (one cloud endpoint) and
// `spinloop fleet status` (a node per machine) report the same facts about an
// spinloop-driven inference endpoint: its state, what it is serving, how long since
// it last did work, and its spinloop version. Those facts live here, computed once,
// so the two commands cannot word or compute them differently. Each command layers
// its own layout and any facts the other does not carry on top: the remote keeps
// its key-value block and its endpoint's address and health, the fleet keeps its
// one-node-per-row table.

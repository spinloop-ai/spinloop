// The CLI layer's single Viper instance: the one place that reads the SPINLOOP_*
// environment values the CLI owns (SPINLOOP_ALIAS and the SPINLOOP_REMOTE_*
// control-plane settings). Every SPINLOOP_* variable whose precedence is an
// internal contract is deliberately NOT read here — SPINLOOP_PROVIDERS
// (catalog), SPINLOOP_BASE_URL (the injected resolve closures), SPINLOOP_LOG_LEVEL
// (daemon.ParseLevel), SPINLOOP_HARNESS (harness.Resolve, which also reports the
// source of the choice), and the domain-owned SPINLOOP_API_TOKEN /
// SPINLOOP_CONFIG_DIR / SPINLOOP_REMOTE_* of other packages. Reading one of those
// through Viper would create a second reader of the same variable — the exact
// silent drift this migration removes. See the ownership table in
// openspec/changes/migrate-cli-to-cobra-viper/design.md (D3).

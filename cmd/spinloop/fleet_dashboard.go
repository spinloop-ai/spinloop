resource bars, the token counters — repainted on an interval.

The view is read-only apart from three keys: s starts the selected node, a
abandons a start or stop still in flight on it (the wait ends, the node is
free again — a wake the cloud is carrying goes on), x stops it after a
confirmation. The arrow keys move the selection, r forces a refresh, q or
Ctrl+C leaves.

A node that cannot be reached is still a tile, showing why, and a node whose
token reference is unresolvable holds its reason for the life of the view.

metrics --watch instead.`,

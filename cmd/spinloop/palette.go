// The colours and the spinner every surface of the CLI draws from — the
// dashboard's tiles and title bar, `fleet deploy`'s progress lines, the
// resource bars `fleet metrics` and `remote metrics` print. They live together
// so a second surface finds them rather than writing its own copy, which is
// what left the same ten spinner frames declared twice in this package.
//
// The two groups here are read differently and must not be swapped for one
// another. A state colour answers "how is this going" and belongs to whatever
// it is reporting; the brand colours answer "which tool is this" and belong to
// the tool's own chrome. See `openspec/specs/cli-ux/spec.md`.

// accent. They carry the same values as the site's `--accent`, `--ink` and
// `--ink-2` tokens, so the CLI and the site are recognisably one product.
//
// The accent says nothing about a node: the board's title bar and the border
// of the selected panel are drawn from it, and nothing else is.
//
// The inks are written as hex and downsampled by lipgloss to whatever the
// terminal can show. The surface is a 256-colour index instead, because a
// tile's header bar is raw ANSI — the tile body is one plain string under a
// single lipgloss style — while the board's title bar takes the same surface
// through lipgloss, so the two are written from one value.

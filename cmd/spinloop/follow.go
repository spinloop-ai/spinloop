// to stop is not a failure. Both `spinloop remote logs -f` and `spinloop fleet
// logs -f` follow output this way, and the wiring is the part they genuinely
// share: what they poll, and what they do with the answers, is different
// enough that a common loop would fit neither.
//
// The loop is handed the context and is expected to return nil once it is
// cancelled.

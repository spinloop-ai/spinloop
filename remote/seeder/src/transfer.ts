/**
 * Moving bytes from Hugging Face into S3 without staging the model on disk.
 *
 * Each file is an S3 multipart upload whose parts are filled by ranged GETs, a
 * bounded number in flight at once:
 *
 *     for each 64 MiB window:  GET …/resolve/… Range: bytes=lo-hi  ──▶ UploadPart(n)
 *
 * The shape is chosen for failure, not for speed. A part is independently
 * retryable, so a blip 25 GB into a file costs 64 MiB rather than the file —
 * finer-grained than a whole-file resume. A part that exhausts its retries does
 * not fail the seed: that one file falls back to disk staging, which bounds disk
 * use to a single file rather than the whole model. Streaming is the default;
 * robustness is the fallback.

/**
 * What a seed's state is.
 *
 * Neither source is sufficient alone. CloudWatch only knows what the seed
 * managed to say, and a job killed by the kernel says nothing more — so records
 * alone report "41%" for ever. EC2 only knows whether compute exists, which
 * does not distinguish a seed that succeeded from one that died. The state is
 * therefore the join of the two, and the interesting cell is the one where the
 * instance is gone and the last record was not terminal: that is a failure, and
 * must never be reported as progress.
 *
 *                     last record
 *                 (none)   in-flight   terminal
 *   pending/      starting  running     finishing
 *   running
 *   gone          failed    FAILED      that outcome

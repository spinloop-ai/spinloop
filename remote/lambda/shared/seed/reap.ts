/**
 * Layer three of the seed's termination guarantee: the control plane's own

 *
 * Layer one is the seeder's exit handling and the boot script's EXIT trap;
 * layer two is `shutdown -h +N` armed before anything can hang. Both run on the
 * instance, so neither survives a kernel that kills it or a boot that never got
 * as far as user-data. This does.
 *
 * The decision is kept pure so every branch is testable without EC2 or
 * CloudWatch, and separate from the inference sweep's decideIdle because the two
 * judge different things from different signals.

# Architecture

Maintainer-facing notes on how this deployment is put together. For *using* it, see
the [README](../README.md); for the pound-and-pence, [costs.md](costs.md).

## What it is

A **scale-to-zero, self-hosted OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint** on AWS. A GPU
instance exists only while you are actually serving requests: a start Lambda
launches one on demand (or re-wakes one the sweep has stopped), and a stop
Lambda stops it after idle, then terminates it after a retention period.
Nothing runs (and almost nothing is billed) at rest.

Three ideas hold it together:

- **The instance is stateless.** No fixed EC2 instance; the weights live in S3
  and are synced onto the instance at boot. The start Lambda launches one from a
  baked AMI, or **re-wakes** a stopped one (its boot disk and synced weights
  survive a stop, so a re-wake skips the launch and the sync) — and the stop
  Lambda stops idle ones before terminating them past retention.
- **The runner is pluggable.** The inference server (currently vLLM; llama.cpp
  landing) is chosen per deployment, not hard-wired. A runner-neutral
  *deploy-config* says what to serve; the start Lambda builds the right command.
- **Deployment config is data, not a redeploy.** What to serve (runner, model,
  context, serve args) lives in an SSM parameter written by a deploy Lambda, so
  switching model or runner is a parameter write — no `cdk deploy`.

```

The Lambdas live **outside the VPC** (no NAT cost) and reach the instance over
**SSM Run Command** — a `curl` to the on-instance **spinloop daemon**'s
loopback control API (`127.0.0.1:4242`), which supervises the engine and
collects its metrics — so nothing is exposed beyond the vLLM port, and that
only to your `/32`. A stable **Elastic IP** is re-associated on each launch so
the base URL never changes.

## The deploy-config control plane

The seam between "what infra exists" (CDK's job, provisioned once) and "what to
serve" (per deployment). `spinloop remote deploy` reads a Spinloop file and POSTs a
DeployConfig to the deploy Lambda; the Lambda validates it and writes the
`/cloud-vm-llm/deploy-config` SSM parameter. The next wake reads it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  spinloopfile["Spinloop file<br/>(runner, MODEL, CONTEXT, preset)"]
  spinloop["spinloop remote deploy"]
  deploy["DeployFn<br/>(validate)"]
  param[("deploy-config<br/>SSM param")]
  seed["seed instance<br/>(if weights missing)"]
  start["StartFn (next wake)"]

  spinloopfile --> spinloop -->|SigV4 POST| deploy
  deploy -->|PutParameter| param
  deploy -.->|RunInstances, returns seedId| seed --> s3[("S3 weights")]
  start -->|read| param
  start -->|render daemon deploy-config| unit["spinloop daemon"]
```

The DeployConfig contract (`lambda/shared/deploy-config.ts`):

```
{ runner: "vllm" | "llamacpp",   // required; no default
  modelId, quant, contextSize, servedModelName,
  serveArgs: string[] }          // runner-specific flags, pre-tokenised
```

`weightsPrefix` is **not** part of the wire contract — the Lambda derives it as
`models/<runner>/<modelId>[/<quant>]/` and stores it in the parameter, so callers
never encode the S3 layout (and a prefix sent in the body is ignored). If those
weights are not in the bucket, the Lambda launches a seed itself and replies
`{seeding: true, seedId}`; a wake before it finishes would sync an incomplete
prefix, so wait for it. The id is stable (derived from the weights), unlike the
instance it replaced, so it is what `spinloop remote seed status` takes.

## Seeding

A seed is a supervised job, not a fire-and-forget script.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  cli["spinloop remote seed<br/>start | status | ls | stop"]
  seedfn["SeedFn (Function URL)"]
  deployfn["DeployFn<br/>(auto-seed on missing weights)"]
  inst["c7g.large, stock AL2023<br/>no bake"]
  hf[("Hugging Face")]
  s3[("S3 weights + _seed.json")]
  cw[("CloudWatch<br/>/cloud-vm-llm/seed")]
  sweep["StopFn seed pass<br/>rate(5 min)"]

  cli -->|SigV4| seedfn
  deployfn -->|shared module| inst
  seedfn -->|RunInstances, deterministic ClientToken| inst
  inst -->|ranged parts ──▶ S3 multipart| s3
  hf --> inst
  inst -->|EMF records| cw
  seedfn -->|status: records ⋈ EC2| cw
  sweep -->|reap stalled / over-age| inst
```

The pieces that matter:

- **Identity is derived, not supplied.** `seedIdFor(runner, modelId, quant)` is a
  slug of the same inputs that determine the weights prefix
  (`vllm--Qwen-Qwen3-32B`), so the same model always converges on the same seed
  and different models get their own.
- **Convergence is EC2's.** `RunInstances` deduplicates a repeated `ClientToken`
  within 24 hours, so two simultaneous starts collapse to one instance with no
  lock. The same window would also swallow a legitimate later retry, so the
  launch path checks the state of whatever instance comes back and escapes a
  dead one with a fresh generation.
- **Transfer is streaming with a floor.** 64 MiB ranged `GET`s feed an S3
  multipart upload, eight in flight; a failed part is retried alone. A part that
  exhausts its retries drops that one file to disk staging, so no model needs
  disk proportional to its size and streaming can never wedge.
- **Status is a join.** Records say what the seed managed to report; EC2 says
  whether it still exists. A gone instance whose last record was mid-transfer is
  `failed`, never "41% for ever".
- **Three termination layers**: the seeder's exit handling, `shutdown -h +60`
  armed as the boot script's first command, and the sweep's seed pass — which
  judges liveness from `DescribeLogStreams`'s `lastEventTimestamp`, *not* the
  daemon scrape used for inference instances (a seed runs no daemon).

At boot, `buildInferenceUserData()` renders it into the on-instance spinloop
daemon's own deploy config — the model as the synced local path, the bind
address and per-runner key delivery resolved into the serve args — and the
daemon builds the engine command from there (`vllm serve …` or
`llama-server …`). There is **no default runner**: an unset or invalid config
fails the wake loudly rather than guessing.

The parameter is **spinloop/manual-owned**. CDK creates it with a constant
`unconfigured` placeholder — deliberately *not* the cfg-derived config — so a
later `cdk deploy` can never clobber what `spinloop remote deploy` (or a manual
edit) put there. `pnpm run deploy`'s seed step (`scripts/seed-deploy-config.mjs`)
writes a cfg-derived initial config over the placeholder *only* while it is still
unconfigured, and only when CDK knows the full serve config (vLLM); llama.cpp's
serve args come from a Spinloop, so its config is left for `spinloop remote deploy`
to set.

## Wake lifecycle

`spinloop remote start` (or any POST to the start Function URL) blocks until the
server is answering, so the caller gets one "ready" with the base URL + key.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant O as spinloop remote start
  participant S as StartFn
  participant P as deploy-config (SSM)
  participant E as EC2
  participant I as instance
  O->>S: POST (SigV4)
  S->>P: read deploy-config
  alt unconfigured
    S-->>O: 503 "run spinloop remote deploy"
  end
  S->>E: RunInstances (try each g6e AZ until capacity)
  S->>E: associate Elastic IP
  loop until healthy or deadline
    S->>I: SSM curl localhost/health
  end
  Note over I: boot → swap → S3 sync weights → serve
  S-->>O: 200 ready {base_url, api_key}
```

Boot user-data (built by the start Lambda from the deploy-config): log
`nvidia-smi`, add a swapfile, `aws s3 sync` the weights, fetch the API key, then
write the daemon's deploy config, start `spinloop daemon` (loopback `:4242`), and
request the engine's first start over its control API. The health check hits
`/health` on the port — portable across runners.

## Idle / stop

Engine activity is judged **on the instance**, not here. The daemon samples its
engine's counters every 15 seconds and reports `idleSeconds` on `/v1/status`;
the Lambda reads that number and applies the policy only it knows — retention,
the hard cap, the grace period.

The shutdown is **tiered**: an idle running instance is *stopped* (its boot
disk and the weights synced onto it survive, so a start re-wakes it in seconds
rather than re-launching from the AMI), and a stopped instance is *terminated*
once it has slept longer than `stopRetentionMinutes` — no volume is billed
forever. The stop Lambda marks its own stops with a `Stopped-At` instance tag
(EC2 has no stop time to read), and the start Lambda records a `Started-At`
tag on each re-wake so the max-runtime cap and grace period measure the current
session, not first boot.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  tick["EventBridge tick<br/>(every 5 min)"] --> state{"instance<br/>state?"}
  state -->|stopped| sret{"stopped longer than<br/>stopRetentionMinutes?"}
  sret -->|yes| term["TerminateInstances"]
  sret -->|no| wait4["wait"]
  state -->|running| retain{"Retain-Until<br/>in the future?"}
  retain -->|yes| wait1["wait"]
  retain -->|no| cap{"past max runtime?"}
  cap -->|yes| stopit["StopInstances<br/>+ Stopped-At tag"]
  cap -->|no| grace{"within grace<br/>of session start?"}
  grace -->|yes| wait2["wait"]
  grace -->|no| scrape["SSM: scrape /v1/status"]
  scrape --> idle{"daemon idleSeconds<br/>> threshold?"}
  idle -->|yes| stopit
  idle -->|no| wait3["wait"]
```

That split is what fixed the sampling blip: one scrape every five minutes could
land in a lull between requests and read a busy endpoint as idle, whereas the
daemon has taken ~60 readings in that window. It also means the control plane
keeps no activity history — there is no `idle-state` parameter and no wake
timestamp, because the daemon counts an engine start as activity itself.

A daemon that cannot be reached, or that answers without a last-active time,
counts as "no activity", so a wedged box is still stopped at the threshold
rather than burning GPU-hours. There is deliberately **no fallback** to reading
counters: an instance whose daemon predates this behaviour (booted before it
shipped and never re-woken) reports no last-active time and is treated as
idle. Boot installs the daemon — the deploy config's pin, or the latest
release — so a fresh boot always reports it. A stopped instance with no
`Stopped-At` tag
(stopped outside the control plane, or a crash between the stop and its tag) is
self-healed: the next sweep records the stop time and gives it the full
retention. A `Retain-Until` instance tag (UTC ISO-8601) overrides both the idle
timer and the max-runtime cap (and, on a stopped instance, its termination);
`spinloop remote pause` stops an instance on purpose, and a manual
`spinloop remote stop` still terminates it immediately.

## Image stack

`cloud-vm-llm-image` defines an **Image Builder pipeline**, not an image — so
`cdk deploy` is instant and a bad bake can never fail the stack. `pnpm bake`
triggers a build out-of-band; each successful bake tags its AMI (role, and — as
the second runner lands — runner), and the start Lambda launches the **newest
AMI matching the tags**. A slim AMI carries only the driver + the runner
(vLLM as a `uv` venv; llama.cpp as a prebuilt CUDA `llama-server`) — no
Docker, and no spinloop: each instance's boot installs the daemon (the deploy
config's pin, or the latest release), so the AMI never carries a release of it.

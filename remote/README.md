# remote — the cloud GPU deployment

The deployment [`spinloop remote`](../docs/commands/remote.md) drives:
scale-to-zero, self-hosted LLM endpoints on AWS, each exposing an
OpenAI-compatible API for use as a coding-agent backend. It is split into two
layers. A **control plane** — the lifecycle Lambdas, the weights bucket, the
VPC and the AMI bake pipelines — is deployed **once per account** by
`spinloop remote bootstrap`. **Environments** — one per endpoint, each with its
own Elastic IP, API key and allowed CIDR — are created on it by
`spinloop remote deploy`, as many as you need side by side. An environment's GPU
instance exists only while you are actually using it: the start Lambda
launches it on demand (and re-wakes it when it is merely stopped), and the
stop Lambda's idle sweep stops it after a period of idleness, then terminates
it after a further retention period.

The inference engine is **pluggable** — [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
or [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai). The deployed default is llama.cpp, serving
Unsloth's `Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF` at **128k context** with a q8 KV cache and
**multi-token prediction** (~0.8 draft acceptance, so decode is roughly twice
what it would be without). Which engine you get is decided by one line in an
`Spinloop` file, not by a redeploy.

The instance is **stateless**, and responsibilities are split cleanly:

- A slim **AMI per engine** (baked by the image stack via EC2 Image Builder)
  carries only the NVIDIA driver and that engine — a `uv` venv for vLLM, a
  prebuilt CUDA `llama-server` for llama.cpp. No Docker. Both are
  model-agnostic and rarely change.
- The **model weights** live in an **S3 bucket**, put there by a disposable
  seed job that streams them from Hugging Face entirely within AWS. You do not
  run it by hand: deploying a model whose weights are missing starts it for you,
  and `spinloop remote seed` starts, follows, lists and stops one directly. The
  seed runs on a **stock Amazon Linux image** — it needs no bake — reports its
  progress and outcome to CloudWatch, and terminates itself on success and on
  failure alike. A prefix is complete when it holds a `_seed.json` manifest,
  which also records the exact revision the weights came from.
 - At boot the instance **syncs the weights from S3** onto its disk (~2–4 min)
   and starts its spinloop daemon pointed at them. The daemon starts no engine
   itself: the start Lambda issues the engine's start (with the deploy config
   as its body) once the daemon answers, on a fresh launch and a re-wake
   alike.

Because the AMI is a regional artifact, the start Lambda can launch in **any**
availability zone — it tries each g6e zone in turn until one has capacity.

The image stack defines an Image Builder **pipeline**, not a build, so
deploying it never runs (or fails on) a bake. You trigger bakes out-of-band
with `pnpm bake <runner>`; each successful bake **tags** its AMI with its
engine, and the start Lambda launches the **newest AMI matching the engine it
was told to run**. A failed bake produces no new AMI and changes nothing.

The control plane **renders** the boot script and the daemon's service unit,
and the boot script **installs** the spinloop binary that runs them — the
release its deploy config pins, or the latest release. Keep that coupling
honest: ship a new spinloop release, and only then `pnpm deploy` a control
plane that renders units or scripts the new binary understands — the other
order launches instances whose daemon never starts.

```

Inference traffic goes directly from your machine to the instance; the Lambdas
only orchestrate. They live outside the VPC (no NAT gateway cost) and observe
the engine by running `curl localhost` on the instance via SSM Run Command, so
nothing is exposed beyond the API port itself, and that only to your IP. A
stable Elastic IP is re-associated with each launch so the endpoint URL never
changes.

For how the pieces fit together — the stacks, the deploy-config control plane,
and the wake/idle lifecycle — see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with admin (or equivalent) credentials configured locally
- Node.js 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- The [`spinloop`](https://github.com/spinloop-ai/spinloop) CLI, which drives the
  endpoint
- AWS CLI v2, plus the [Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
  for shell access (there is no SSH)

> **⚠️ GPU quota**: new AWS accounts have a vCPU quota of **0** for G-series
> instances, which makes the very first `start` fail. Check before deploying:
>
> ```sh
> aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ec2 \
>   --quota-code L-DB2E81BA --region us-east-1 \
>   --query 'Quota.Value'
> ```
>
> A `g6e.xlarge` needs 4 vCPUs. If the value is below 4, request an increase
> for "Running On-Demand G and VT instances" and expect approval to take up to
> a day or two. (The quota is per region — a grant in one region does not carry
> to another.)

**Changing region?** g6e coverage is patchy: the region must offer the type at
all (none of eu-west-1/eu-west-2 do), and within a region it exists in only
some AZs (in us-east-1, not us-east-1a). Set `availabilityZones` to the g6e
zones — the start Lambda tries them in order. List what your account sees:

```sh
aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --location-type availability-zone \
  --region <region> --filters Name=instance-type,Values=g6e.xlarge \
  --query 'InstanceTypeOfferings[].Location'
```

## Deploy

The one-time account setup is
[`spinloop remote bootstrap`](../docs/commands/remote.md#bootstrapping-the-account),
which drives this directory for you — download, consent plan, then the shared
deploy and the AMI bakes. Endpoints come after it, one `spinloop remote deploy`
per environment:

```sh
spinloop remote bootstrap   # once per account: control-plane stack + pipelines + bakes
spinloop remote deploy      # creates the Spinloop's REMOTE environment and says
                          # what it serves; seeds the weights if missing
```

Under the hood, bootstrap runs this directory's own commands — usable by hand
too:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm cdk bootstrap     # once per account/region
pnpm deploy:image      # creates the bake pipelines — instant, no build yet
pnpm bake llamacpp     # bakes that engine's AMI — ~15-25 min, in the background
pnpm run deploy        # deploys the control-plane stack (Lambdas, VPC, S3 bucket)
```

- `pnpm deploy:image` only creates the pipelines, so it deploys in seconds and
  can never fail because of a bake.
- `pnpm bake <vllm|llamacpp>` builds that engine's AMI and returns immediately;
  the build runs asynchronously — check it with the `aws imagebuilder get-image`
  command the script prints. Re-bake only when the engine version or the driver
  changes; the model is **not** baked in.
- `pnpm run deploy` deploys the **control-plane stack** — VPC, the lifecycle Lambdas,
  the S3 weights bucket, roles — and publishes its outputs for discovery. It
  creates no Elastic IP and no environment.
- `spinloop remote deploy` reads the [`Spinloop`](Spinloop) and its
  [`preset.ini`](preset.ini), creates the environment the Spinloop's `REMOTE`
  names (its EIP, API key, ingress scoped to your `--allowed-cidr`, defaulting
  to your public IP), registers it under `~/.config/spinloop/remotes/<env>/`, and
  tells it what to serve. If those weights are not in S3 it starts the seed job
  itself, all within AWS, and prints the command that follows it — wait for the
  seed to reach `succeeded` before the first `start`, since a wake before then
  would sync an incomplete prefix.

> Use `pnpm run deploy`, not `pnpm deploy` — the latter is pnpm's own built-in
> `deploy` command. And don't pass `-c` flags through it: pnpm appends extra
> arguments to the **last** command in the script chain, not to `cdk deploy`.
> Put context in `cdk.json` instead.

The bake and the weight seed are independent and can run in parallel.

Everything per-environment — the model, the engine, the context window, the
allowed CIDR — is given to `spinloop remote deploy`, not to the stack. `.env` can
hold `HF_TOKEN` for gated model repos (used only when seeding). The shared
layer's own settings all have defaults, overridable in `cdk.json`:

| Context key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `region` | `us-east-1` | g6e is not offered everywhere (absent from all of eu-west-1/2) |
| `availabilityZones` | `us-east-1b,c,d,e` | g6e zones the start Lambda tries, in order |
| `hfToken` | *(empty)* | Only for gated repos; used only when seeding |
| `instanceType` | `g6e.xlarge` | Runtime GPU type, 1× L40S 48 GB, ~$1.86/hr |
| `builderInstanceType` | `m5.xlarge` | Cheap non-GPU type used to bake the AMI |
| `seedInstanceType` | `c7g.large` | Seed job type. Avoid the t-family: a sustained pull exhausts its CPU and network burst credits |
| `maxSeedMinutes` | `60` | Hard cap on a seed's life — the boot script's `shutdown -h +N` and the sweep read this one value |
| `seedStallMinutes` | `10` | Silence after which a seed is treated as stalled and reaped early |
| `maxConcurrentSeeds` | `3` | Bound on seeds in flight, so a caller in a loop cannot launch unbounded compute |
| `seedLogRetentionDays` | `3` | Seed records — longer than engine logs, since they record what is in the bucket and why |
| `logRetentionDays` | `1` | Per-engine and boot logs — short, since they exist to catch a short-lived instance's crash, not for audit |
| `lambdaLogRetentionDays` | `3` | The control Lambdas' own execution logs — without this, Lambda auto-creates a log group with no retention and keeps every invocation forever |
| `imageVolumeGb` | `80` | AMI root — fits the OS + engine + the model synced at boot |
| `llamacppRelease` | `b10435` | Pinned ai-dock/llama.cpp-cuda build baked into the llama.cpp AMI |
| `vllmVersion` | `0.26.0` | vLLM version installed into that AMI's venv (`uv pip install`) |
| `nvidiaDriverPackage` | `nvidia-driver-570-server-open` | Driver installed in both AMIs |
| `idleThresholdMinutes` | `15` | Stop after this long without requests |
| `stopRetentionMinutes` | `60` | Keep a stopped instance (re-wakeable) this long before terminating it |
| `gracePeriodMinutes` | `30` | Never stop this soon after boot (covers the cold load) |
| `maxRuntimeMinutes` | `240` | Hard stop this long after boot, even if busy |

The **model, quant, context window and engine flags are not in this table** —
they come from the `Spinloop` and its preset via `spinloop remote deploy`, so
changing model is a command, not a redeploy.

What needs what:
- Change **model, quant, context or engine flags** → edit the `Spinloop`/preset,
  then `spinloop remote deploy --overwrite`. No bake, no redeploy.
- Change an environment's **allowed CIDR** →
  `spinloop remote deploy --overwrite --allowed-cidr <ip>/32`.
- Change the **spinloop release** fresh boots install →
  `spinloop remote deploy --overwrite --spinloop-version <x.y.z>` (omit the flag
  for the latest). Takes effect at the next boot — a running instance keeps
  the daemon it was deployed with.
- Change **`llamacppRelease`/`vllmVersion`/`nvidiaDriverPackage`** → bump the
  recipe `version` in `lib/image-stack.ts`, then `pnpm deploy:image` +
  `pnpm bake <runner>`.
- Change a shared setting (idle timers, instance type) → `pnpm run deploy`.

**On the model choice**: BF16 weights for a 27B model are ~54 GB and do not fit
the L40S's 48 GB, so a quantised checkpoint is mandatory. The default Q6_K_XL
GGUF is ~22.5 GB, leaving room for a 128k q8 KV cache (~16 GB) inside 48 GB.
For vLLM, FP8 is hardware-native on the L40S (Ada generation).

### Switching engine, or model

The `Spinloop` is the control surface. `PROVIDER` names the engine, so the same
file that runs a model locally under `spinloop serve` deploys it to the cloud
under `spinloop remote deploy`:

```sh
spinloop remote deploy                 # what ./Spinloop describes
spinloop remote deploy path/to/Spinloop  # something else
spinloop remote deploy --dry-run       # print the config without sending it
```

Cutting back to vLLM means a Spinloop with `PROVIDER vllm` and the FP8 repo as
its `MODEL` — both AMIs stay baked, so it is a deploy, not a rebuild. The start
Lambda launches the AMI matching the engine the environment's deploy-config
names, so nothing else has to agree.

#### Companion weights

A model published with extra files beside its weights — a speculative-decoding
drafter, a perception encoder — can carry them too. The deploy-config names
them by **role**, and `spinloop remote deploy` fills that in from the preset keys
that already drive a local serve:

| Preset key | Role | Synced to | Engine flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec-draft-model` (`md`) | `draft` | `draft.gguf` | `--spec-draft-model` |
| `mmproj` (`mm`) | `mmproj` | `mmproj.gguf` | `--mmproj` |

Only the **filename** travels: a companion ships in the model's own repo, so
the preset's local path is dropped and the seed fetches that name from Hugging
Face. The deployment then names the file at its own synced path, so nothing
depends on where you keep it locally.

How the engine *uses* a companion is still yours — `--spec-type draft-dflash`
stays in the preset and passes through untouched.

Adding a companion to a model already in S3 re-seeds it: presence is judged
over the whole expected set, so the instance can never start pointing at a
companion that was never synced.

### First boot

A wake is an instance launch, an **S3 sync of the weights**, then loading
them into VRAM and warm-up. The launch provisions the root volume's gp3
throughput and IOPS to their ceiling (an unprovisioned gp3 caps at 125 MiB/s
and 3,000 IOPS, which used to throttle both the sync and the load — the sync
runs at the volume's throughput, and the engine's page-faulted load at its
IOPS). A cold boot is roughly **5–7 minutes** end to
end, every time, with no Hugging Face dependency. The first request after a cold start also pays a one-off warm-up
(~30 s); steady-state decode is around 28 tokens/s. Watch a wake:

```sh
pnpm console                                 # SSM shell onto the running instance
tail -f /var/lib/spinloop/daemon/engine.log    # engine logs (both runners)
tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log       # boot: s3 sync progress
```

## Daily use

The endpoint is driven by the `spinloop` CLI, using this directory's `Spinloop`;
its `REMOTE` names the environment `deploy` registered under
`~/.config/spinloop/remotes/<env>/`. Run these from this directory (`spinloop`
reads `./Spinloop`):

```sh
spinloop remote start    # boots (or re-wakes a stopped) the instance, blocks
                        # until it is serving, prints OPENAI_BASE_URL + OPENAI_API_KEY exports
spinloop apply           # points your coding agent at the endpoint
spinloop remote status   # instance state + endpoint health
spinloop remote pause    # stop now (no terminate); a later start re-wakes it
spinloop remote stop     # terminate now instead of waiting for the idle timer
```

`spinloop apply` writes the endpoint's base URL and API key into your harness
config, so export the key that `spinloop remote start` prints first. The base URL
comes from the environment's `remote.json` (`base_url`), since the Spinloop
states none; a `BASEURL` in the Spinloop would override it. The model
name to request is the Spinloop's `ALIAS` (`qwen3.6-27b`) — the same value the
server is started under, so the two cannot drift:

```sh
eval "$(spinloop remote start)"   # sets OPENAI_BASE_URL + OPENAI_API_KEY
curl "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
curl "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.6-27b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'
```

> Qwen3.6 is a reasoning model and will happily spend a small token budget
> entirely on thinking, returning empty `content` with the text in
> `reasoning_content`. Give requests generous `max_tokens`.

### Idle behaviour

The on-instance spinloop daemon reads its engine's request/token counters every
15 seconds and keeps track of when the engine was last doing work, which it
reports as `lastActiveAt` and `idleSeconds` on `/v1/status`. Every 5 minutes
the stop Lambda asks for that (via SSM) and **stops** the instance once
`idleSeconds` passes `idleThresholdMinutes`. With defaults, expect that
**15–20 minutes** after the last request.

Stopping (rather than terminating) keeps the boot disk and the weights the
boot synced onto it, so the next `spinloop remote start` **re-wakes** the
instance — a boot without a fresh launch and a no-op S3 sync — instead of
launching one from the AMI. The stop clears the page cache, so the re-wake
re-pays the model load; it skips only the sync, and lands in the same band as
a cold boot. The stopped instance
is billed for its volume only, not compute, and the sweep **terminates** it
once it has been stopped longer than `stopRetentionMinutes` (default 1 h):
after that, the next start is a fresh launch again. `spinloop remote pause`
does the same stop on purpose.

Sampling on the box is what makes this reliable: a busy endpoint that happens
to have nothing in flight at the moment a 5-minute sweep lands used to read as
idle, because that single sample was the entire signal. Sixty samples between
sweeps cannot miss traffic the way one can.

If the daemon cannot be reached, or answers without a last-active time, the
instance is treated as showing no activity and is still stopped at the
threshold — deliberately, so a wedged box does not run up GPU-hours unnoticed.
That second case is also why the **runtime AMIs must be re-baked before the
control plane is deployed**: an spinloop older than daemon-owned idle detection
reports no last-active time, and there is no fallback to counter scraping.

There is also a hard cap: `maxRuntimeMinutes` (default 4 hours) stops the
instance that long after its session started **even if requests are still
flowing**, as a backstop against a runaway session. A session begins at launch
or re-wake (the control plane records both on the instance), so it caps one
running session, not anything cumulative — if you hit it mid-work, `spinloop
remote start` brings the endpoint back for another 4 hours. Like the idle
stop, it lands on the next 5-minute tick.

**Pinning an instance up**: tag it `Retain-Until` with a UTC ISO-8601 time and
neither the idle timer nor the hard cap will touch it until then — handy while
debugging on the box. A manual `spinloop remote stop` still works.

```sh
aws ec2 create-tags --resources <instance id> \
  --tags Key=Retain-Until,Value=2026-07-25T22:45:00Z
```

## Costs

At rest (nothing running) the endpoint costs only the **Elastic IP, the S3
weights (~$0.60/mo for the 26 GB GGUF), the AMI snapshots, and Secrets
Manager — roughly $6–7/month**. Between the idle stop and the instance's
termination after `stopRetentionMinutes`, its stopped root volume adds a small
EBS charge; long-term idle costs the same as today,
because the sweep does terminate eventually. While running it is
**$1.86/hour in us-east-1**; ~2 h of
coding a day lands around $90/month. Full breakdown in
[docs/costs.md](docs/costs.md).

## Operations

- **Logs**: `pnpm console` (an SSM shell onto the running instance) then
  `tail -f /var/lib/spinloop/daemon/engine.log` (the engine, both runners) or
  `tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log` (boot / S3 sync). The engine log and
  the boot log are also shipped to CloudWatch — groups `/cloud-vm-llm/<engine>`
  and `/cloud-vm-llm/boot`, stream `<env>/<instance-id>` — so they survive the
  instance's termination. Lambda decisions (launch AZ, idle/terminate, deploys)
  are in the three Lambdas' CloudWatch log groups.
- **Changing the model**: edit the `Spinloop`/preset and run `spinloop remote
  deploy`. It seeds the new weights if needed. No bake, no redeploy.
- **Changing the engine version or the driver**: update `llamacppRelease` /
  `vllmVersion` / `nvidiaDriverPackage`, **bump the recipe (and component)
  `version` in `lib/image-stack.ts`** (Image Builder versions are immutable),
  then `pnpm deploy:image` + `pnpm bake <runner>`.
- **Your home IP changed**: `spinloop remote deploy --overwrite --allowed-cidr
  <ip>/32`. Ingress is per environment, and an existing environment keeps its
  ingress unless a CIDR is passed explicitly — auto-detection applies only to a
  first deploy.
- **Force a fresh AMI** (same config): just `pnpm bake <runner>` — the runtime
  launches the newest tagged AMI.
- **Seeding weights**: `spinloop remote seed start` fetches the model a Spinloop
  names into S3, and `spinloop remote seed status <seed-id>` follows it. Deploying
  starts a seed automatically when the weights are missing and prints the id to
  follow. Other subcommands: `spinloop remote seed ls` (what is in flight, with
  progress) and `spinloop remote seed stop <seed-id>`.
- **Force a re-seed** of weights already in S3: either `spinloop remote seed
  start --force`, or `spinloop remote deploy --reseed` to re-fetch and redeploy
  in one step. An ordinary start/deploy does nothing when the weights are
  already there.
- **Pin the revision** a seed fetches: `spinloop remote seed start --revision
  <commit>`. Without one, the repository's default branch is used and the commit
  it resolved to is recorded in the prefix's `_seed.json`.

### Migrating weights seeded before the manifest

A prefix is now judged complete by the `_seed.json` manifest the seeder writes
last, replacing a per-runner sentinel file. Weights seeded by the old script
carry no manifest, so **they read as absent and are seeded once more** the next
time they are deployed. That is a real one-off cost in time and transfer for a
populated bucket, and it is the intended behaviour: nothing recorded that those
files are complete, which revision they came from, or what they should hash to.

There is deliberately **no backfill helper**. Writing a manifest over files that
nobody verified would assert exactly the guarantee the manifest exists to make
real. If you would rather not re-seed, the honest options are to leave the old
prefix in place unused, or to re-seed it deliberately with
`spinloop remote seed start --force`.

> **Rotate your Hugging Face token** if you ran the old seed with one. It fetched

### Diagnostics

`pnpm console` drops you onto the running instance over SSM (needs
`session-manager-plugin`). Once there:

| Want to know | Command |
|---|---|
| Engine state (idle/running/stopped/crashed) | `curl -s 127.0.0.1:4242/v1/status` |
| Engine + host metrics | `curl -s 127.0.0.1:4242/v1/metrics` |
| Follow the engine's logs | `tail -f /var/lib/spinloop/daemon/engine.log` |
| Why it won't start | `tail -50 /var/lib/spinloop/daemon/engine.log` (or the boot log below for a pre-engine failure) |
| Is it up? | `systemctl is-active spinloop-daemon` · `ss -ltn \| grep :8000` |
| Is MTP actually working | `grep 'draft acceptance' /var/lib/spinloop/daemon/engine.log` |
| Boot / S3-sync progress | `tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log` |
| Weights pulled so far | `du -sh /opt/llm/model` |
| GPU + driver | `nvidia-smi` |
| RAM + swap | `free -h` |

(Both runners run under the same `spinloop-daemon` unit: the `spinloop` binary
the boot installed supervises the engine and serves its control API on
loopback `:4242`.)

From your own machine, no shell needed (the EIP is `<endpoint>`):

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://<endpoint>:8000/health   # 200 once serving
eval "$(spinloop remote start)"                                            # base URL + key
curl "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

The Lambdas log every decision to CloudWatch. In the **stop** Lambda's log
group, each 5-minute tick prints a JSON line — grep `"mode":"idle"` to see why
it kept or terminated the instance (e.g. `"decision":"stop","reason":"idle for
32.9 min"`, or `"reason":"retained until …"` when a `Retain-Until` tag is set).
The **start** Lambda logs the launch AZ and each wake phase.

## Security notes

- The API port is only reachable from `allowedCidr`, and the engine itself
  requires the generated API key (stored in Secrets Manager) as a second layer.
- Traffic is plain HTTP, so the API key is visible in transit; the /32
  restriction is what makes this acceptable for solo use. The planned fix —
  which also ends the allowed-CIDR juggling when your home IP changes — is
  joining the instance to a tailnet: see
  [docs/tailscale-plan.md](docs/tailscale-plan.md).
- No SSH ingress; shell access is via SSM Session Manager. IMDSv2 is enforced.
- The Function URLs require SigV4-signed requests (`lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl`),
  so `spinloop` needs no AWS permissions beyond invoking them.

## Teardown

```sh
pnpm cdk destroy cloud-vm-llm cloud-vm-llm-image
```

Removes both stacks. If an instance is currently running, terminate it first
(`spinloop remote stop`) — it is not owned by CloudFormation. The **S3 weights
bucket is retained** on destroy (so you don't lose the seeded weights); baked
AMIs and their snapshots are not owned by the stacks either. Delete the bucket,
deregister the AMIs, and delete their snapshots by hand to reclaim that storage.

## Troubleshooting

- **`start` returns `unconfigured`**: nothing has been deployed yet. Run
  `spinloop remote deploy`.
- **`start` returns `no-ami`**: no AMI is tagged for the engine you asked for.
  Run `pnpm bake <runner>` and wait for it to reach `AVAILABLE`.
- **`start` returns `no-capacity`**: every configured AZ was out of g6e
  capacity at that moment. The start Lambda already tried them all; wait a few
  minutes and retry, or widen/adjust `availabilityZones`.
- **A bake fails**: it does **not** touch the stack or the previous AMI. Check
  it with `aws imagebuilder get-image --image-build-version-arn <arn>` (the arn
  `pnpm bake` printed) and the CloudWatch log group for the recipe, fix, and
  `pnpm bake` again. The driver install is the most likely failure — adjust
  `nvidiaDriverPackage`.
- **`deploy:image` fails with "recipe/component version already exists"**: you
  changed a baked-in setting without bumping the `version` on the recipe (or
  component) in `lib/image-stack.ts`. Bump and redeploy. The base Ubuntu image
  is exempt — the recipe name carries the AMI id, so a new Canonical release
  replaces the recipe on its own.
- **`start` reaches `running` but never `ready`, or the model is empty**: the
  weights aren't in S3 yet, or a seed is still running. Ask the seed:
  `spinloop remote seed ls`, then `spinloop remote seed status <seed-id>`. A seed
  reports `failed` with a reason even after its instance is gone, so this works
  for a seed that died as well as one still going.
- **A seed failed**: `spinloop remote seed status <seed-id>` names the reason. The
  underlying records are in the `/cloud-vm-llm/seed` log group under stream
  `<seed-id>/<instance-id>` and outlive the instance. Common causes are a gated
  repository with no `hfToken` configured, a quant whose selection matches more
  than one file (split quants are refused rather than half-seeded), and a
  checksum mismatch.
- **Quota errors on launch**: see the GPU quota warning above.
- **`start` times out repeatedly**: `pnpm console` onto the instance and read
  `tail -50 /var/lib/spinloop/daemon/engine.log` (or `/cloud-vm-llm/llamacpp` in
  CloudWatch if the instance is already gone). Known startup
  crashes, all handled for the defaults but reachable after a bump:
  - `libcudart.so.12: cannot open shared object` — the prebuilt llama.cpp
    tarball bundles only its own libraries, not the CUDA runtime; the AMI
    installs `cuda-cudart-12-8`, `libcublas-12-8` and `libnccl2` for it.
  - `Python.h: No such file or directory` (vLLM) — a model needs Triton's
    runtime compile; the AMI installs `python3.12-dev` for it.
  - `Could not find nvcc` (vLLM) — the FlashInfer sampler wants the CUDA
    toolkit, which the slim AMI omits. The user-data sets
    `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0` (native sampler) to avoid it.
  - Engine start OOM — lower `CONTEXT` in the Spinloop, or use a smaller quant;
    the driver failing to load shows up as a bad `nvidia-smi`.
- **The coding agent reports `the model ... does not exist`**: the `model` id it
  sends must equal what the server serves. Under llama.cpp that is the Spinloop's
  `ALIAS`, which is also what the server is started with, so keep the two the
  same — and if you deploy with a different `ALIAS`, re-run `spinloop apply`.
  Under vLLM there is no alias, so the id is the Hugging Face repo. Either way,
  `curl "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models"` shows the truth.

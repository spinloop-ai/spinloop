// FollowOverlap is how far back of the newest event already seen a follow
// re-asks from by default. The shipping agent's delivery lag means an event
// can land with a timestamp slightly behind one already returned, so a poll
// deliberately re-reads a little; FollowCursor suppresses what it has
// already returned, by event id. Both `spinloop remote logs -f` and a fleet
// node's own log follow share this constant, so a fleet-dashboard poll and a
// standalone follow tolerate the same shipping lag.

// FollowCursor turns repeated LogResult polls into a stream of events shown
// exactly once. CloudWatch offers no resumable read position — Start is a
// lower bound on a query, not a cursor a store can resume from — so a follow
// has to re-ask a little behind the newest event it has already seen, to
// catch anything the shipping agent delivered late, and then suppress by
// event id whatever that overlap re-reads. One cursor holds that state for
// the life of one follow, whether that follow is `spinloop remote logs -f`
// polling in a loop or a fleet node answering repeated Logs calls.

// Package inference holds the vocabulary for what an inference engine should
// serve, shared by every kind of node that runs one: a machine supervised by
// `spinloop daemon`, and a cloud environment driven through its control plane.
//
// It is deliberately a leaf — standard library only — so a node kind can be
// described without depending on how any other kind is reached. What is
// specific to reaching one kind stays with that kind: the AWS control plane in
// internal/remote, the control API in internal/daemon.

// DeployConfig is what the deploy Lambda accepts: the runner-neutral
// description of WHAT to serve, derived from a Spinloop. Deliberately no
// weights prefix — the Lambda derives the S3 layout itself, and seeds the
// weights when they are not there yet, so this stays a statement of intent.

// GPU. On a network volume that is an access pattern served at per-page
// latency, not sequential bandwidth — a 26 GB model can take ten minutes to
// load that way on a volume that would stream the same bytes in under a
// minute. A sequential read that gets ahead of the faults turns them into
// cache hits; when the model does not fit in host memory the tail is simply
// re-read, which is no worse than the engine doing it alone.

// faults as before, and nothing here ever blocks a start.

# spinloop gateway

Serve a [fleet](fleet.md) under one OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The gateway is
the fleet client wearing a server: it holds a `fleet.yaml`, answers
`/v1/models` and completion requests by choosing a node with the fleet's own
selector, and wakes a node when nothing is serving what a request asks for — so
a machine running agents needs nothing but a URL and one token.

```sh
spinloop gateway               # serves ./fleet.yaml on :4000
spinloop gateway --fleet ./fleet.yaml
spinloop gateway --listen 0.0.0.0:4000
spinloop gateway --api-token-file /run/secrets/gateway
```

It runs in the foreground, the way [`spinloop serve`](serve.md) does: it holds
the fleet file it serves, and a signal shuts it down cleanly. On startup it
resolves the fleet file and its own token, and checks the token references the
file names — a `tokenEnv` or `engineTokenEnv` variable set nowhere fails here,
naming the node, rather than surfacing later as a per-request authentication
failure. It prints the address to name in the fleet file's `gateway` section:

```
Gateway for fleet.yaml is listening on [::]:4000
Name http://<this-machine>:4000 in the fleet file's gateway section
```

The host it can know is the one it was told to bind; for a wildcard bind the
machine's own name is only the operator's to know, so the printed address says
`<this-machine>` and you fill in whatever this machine is called from the other
side.

## Pointing an agent at it

A [`gateway` section](../fleet-file.md#gateway) in the fleet file names the address and
the variable holding the token. A launch routed through that file — `spinloop
harness open -f` or `spinloop code -f` — is pointed at the gateway rather than
a node: the section's address is the agent's base URL (with the OpenAI-
compatible `/v1` prefix added when it carries no path), and the agent
authenticates with the gateway's token, resolved the way a key is resolved
elsewhere: an `ENV` instruction, then the process environment, then the `.env`
beside the Spinloop. `OPENAI_API_KEY` stands in where the section names no
variable. An agent pointed at the gateway holds exactly that one credential;
the node tokens and engine keys live with the gateway, which presents them to
the nodes and the engines:

```yaml
# fleet.yaml
gateway:
  url: http://gateway.internal:4000
  tokenEnv: GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

```sh
spinloop code -O=./Spinloop --fleet ./fleet.yaml
```

A Spinloop beside that file then needs only the model, and the address travels
with the file when the gateway moves. See
[The `Spinloop` file](../spinloop-file.md#running-the-model-on-another-machine-you-own).

A gateway resolves the model per request, so a launch through one needs no
Spinloop at all when the fleet file names one: with none given and none
beside the file, it configures opencode or Pi with a generic OpenAI-compatible
provider at the gateway's address, its models populated from the gateway's own
`GET /v1/models`, and no default model — labelled and keyed by the section's
`name` (or its address when none is given), so it reads distinctly in a model
picker and a second gateway does not overwrite this one. See
[Launching the harness](fleet.md#launching-the-harness).

## What it answers

| Path | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `GET /health` | That the gateway is up. It touches no node on purpose — it is how you tell the gateway down from the fleet down. |
| `GET /v1/models` | The OpenAI list of what a request can reach: what the running nodes report (the served name when a node reports one, else the model id), and, for a stopped node [waking can reach](#waking-a-node), the model it would start with — its own Spinloop source for a `kind: daemon` node, its own stats reply for a `kind: remote` one. Duplicates once. Nothing reachable is an empty list, not an error. |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Routed to the node serving the request's `model`, the way a launch routes. |
| `POST /v1/completions` | The same, for the completions endpoint. |
| `GET /v1/fleet` | The fleet's [topology](#the-fleets-topology) — what a [`spinloop orchestrator`](orchestrator.md) reads to work its backlog. |

A request naming no `model` is refused saying so, and a path the gateway does
not serve is refused with a `404` naming the ones it does.

The list is what a request can reach, so it is bounded by what the gateway can
start: a running node contributes only what it reports — a running engine is
never displaced to make room. A deployed-but-stopped `kind: remote`
environment contributes the model id its own stats reply reports — read
directly from its stored deploy config, the way `spinloop remote metrics`
already reads it, since its status reply carries no such facts while
stopped — since the gateway can wake it the same way it wakes a
`kind: daemon` node; one with nothing deployed contributes nothing, and
neither does any node whose own `wake` (or the file's, when it names none)
is off. Each node's source is read at most once in a short window, so a
poll of the models list is cheap.

### Routing a request

A completion request is answered by the fleet's own selection: a node already
running the model wins, ranked by the fleet file's `prefer` with fleet-file
order breaking ties. A node whose engine is bound to loopback without an
[`engine` override](../fleet-file.md#where-a-nodes-engine-answers) is never selected,
and when it is the only match the failure says so rather than holding the
request until the wake timeout.

The request's body goes out unmodified and streamed replies are flushed as
they are produced, so a `stream: true` request streams through. The caller's
authorisation never travels past the gateway: the engine is reached with the
key its fleet entry names (`engineTokenEnv`, or the fleet-wide `apiKeyEnv` for
a `kind: remote` node), and an ungated engine is reached with none. The reply
the engine gives is the reply the caller gets — the gateway never retries
another node, and an upstream failure reaches the caller as an error naming
the node.

### The fleet's topology

`GET /v1/fleet` answers with the fleet as it is now: the same cached fan-out
the model listing reads, joined with the file's claims about each node and its
fleet-level settings. Each node's entry carries its name, kind,
[tags](../fleet-file.md#tags), state, what it serves (the served name where a running
engine reports one, else the model id), whether it has answered its own health
check, when it last did work — and, for a node that is not running, the model
a request would start it with, where the node describes one and
[waking is allowed](../fleet-file.md#waking) for it. The file's `wake` and
`prefer` settings and its [concurrency](../fleet-file.md#concurrency) limits ride
along, each absent where the file declares none. A node that does not answer
is reported in its place — the way the fleet's own views report it — rather
than failing the whole reply.

It is behind the [gateway's token](#the-gateways-token) like everything else it
serves, and it is the [`spinloop orchestrator`](orchestrator.md)'s only view
of the fleet: the orchestrator takes no fleet file of its own.

### Waking a node

When no running node serves the model and [waking is allowed](../fleet-file.md#waking)
for at least one candidate, the gateway starts one and holds the request until
its engine answers. What a node is started with, and how it is picked, depends
on its kind — only nodes describing the requested model are candidates, and
one whose stored config already matches is tried first:

- A **`kind: daemon`** node is started with the config its own Spinloop
  source resolves to.
- A **deployed-but-stopped `kind: remote`** node is booted as it is: its own
  stored deploy config — set by `spinloop remote deploy`, not by this wake —
  decides what it serves, and the gateway pushes nothing new. An
  **undeployed** environment is never a candidate: it has nothing to serve
  yet, and choosing what to deploy is `spinloop remote deploy`'s call, not a
  request's.

The wait is bounded by `--wake-timeout` (default 5m); a timeout fails the
request saying so and leaves the engine running, so a slow load — or, for a
remote node, a slow boot — is not thrown away. Concurrent requests for the
same model wake at most one engine: the gateway coalesces two requests
racing to wake the same node into a single start, so a request that arrives
mid-wake joins the one already under way rather than starting a second
engine of its own — a daemon node's control API would refuse the second
start anyway, but a remote environment's control plane does not, so this is
what keeps a burst of requests from booting (and billing for) more than one
instance.

A request nothing is serving fails without starting anything, naming the node
and the `spinloop fleet start <node>` command that would start it, when no
candidate node may be woken — its own `wake`, or the file's when it names
none, is off — or when no node describes the model at all.

The gateway needs the same environment a machine running
`spinloop fleet start` would: the tokens the fleet file names, set in its
process environment or in a `.env` beside the fleet file.

## The gateway's token

Callers present the gateway's token as a bearer token on every request — a
wrong or missing one is a `401`. The token comes from one of three places, the
same rules the [daemon's](serve.md#the-control-api-api-and-spinloop-daemon)
token follows, and giving two at once is an error rather than a silent
precedence:

| Source | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `--api-token-file <path>` | The file's contents, trimmed. |
| `SPINLOOP_API_TOKEN` | The environment. |
| `--api-token <value>` | The token itself — readable by every local user through `ps`, like the daemon's. |

A non-loopback listen with no token refuses to start, naming the three ways to
supply one; a loopback listen (`--loopback`, or `--listen 127.0.0.1:4000`)
needs none. The default, `:4000`, binds every interface — the shape a gateway
on a shared machine wants, and the reason the token is not optional there.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `-f`, `--fleet` | The fleet file to serve (default `./fleet.yaml`) |
| `--listen` | The address to listen on (default `:4000`) |
| `-l`, `--loopback` | Bind to loopback on the default port (`127.0.0.1:4000`); needs no token |
| `--api-token-file` | Read the gateway's bearer token from this file |
| `--api-token` | The gateway's bearer token |
| `--wake-timeout` | How long to wait for a woken engine to answer (default 5m) |

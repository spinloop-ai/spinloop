## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Control endpoints

The API SHALL provide JSON endpoints to: report status (engine state, what is being served, the engine log path, when the engine was last active, and the daemon's spinloop version); start the engine; stop the engine; return collected metrics; and accept a deploy config. Start SHALL accept an optional deploy config in its request body — validated and persisted exactly as a config push, then started — so a client can say what to run and run it in one call; without a body, start uses the stored config or the Spinloop. The deploy config MAY name the start's pre-warm choice: absent, the daemon's own default applies; set to disabled, the start SHALL skip the page-cache pre-warm for that start alone; set to enabled, it SHALL pre-warm only on a daemon that runs with the pre-warm option. Start SHALL fail when an engine is already running, changing nothing — a body sent with a rejected start SHALL NOT be stored. Stop SHALL succeed when nothing is running (idempotent), and stopping the engine SHALL never terminate `spinloop daemon` — the API keeps answering. Errors SHALL be returned as JSON with a message and a meaningful HTTP status.

Status SHALL report the engine's last-active time as an RFC 3339 timestamp and the idle duration derived from it in seconds, so a caller can judge idleness from a decision the daemon has already made rather than from raw counters it would have to compare itself. Both SHALL be omitted when no engine has ever run, and neither SHALL be inferred by the caller from any other field.

Status SHALL also report the daemon's spinloop version as a string, set from the binary's build-time version variable. This enables remote callers to verify which spinloop release the node is running without SSH access.

#### Scenario: Status reports the supervised state

- **WHEN** a status request is made
- **THEN** the response reports the engine state, the model/runner being served (when known), the engine log path, and the spinloop version

#### Scenario: Status reports engine activity

- **WHEN** a status request is made while an engine is running that has served work
- **THEN** the response reports the last-active timestamp and the number of seconds since it

#### Scenario: Status omits activity when there is none to report

- **WHEN** a status request is made on a daemon that has never started an engine
- **THEN** the response carries no last-active timestamp and no idle duration

#### Scenario: Status reports version from build time

- **WHEN** a status request is made
- **THEN** the response includes the `version` field set to the binary's build-time version string

#### Scenario: Start and stop drive the engine

- **WHEN** a start request is made while the engine is `idle`, `stopped`, or `crashed`
- **THEN** the daemon starts the engine and the response reports the new state

#### Scenario: Start carries its own deploy config

- **WHEN** a start request carries a deploy config naming a servable runner and model, and no engine is running
- **THEN** the config is validated, persisted, and the engine starts serving it

#### Scenario: A start may disable the pre-warm

- **WHEN** a start request's deploy config sets the pre-warm to disabled, and the daemon runs with the pre-warm option
- **THEN** the engine starts without the page-cache pre-warm, and the daemon's option is unchanged for later starts

#### Scenario: Start body is rejected while running

- **WHEN** a start request carrying a deploy config arrives while an engine is running
- **THEN** the request fails as already-running, the running engine is untouched, and the carried config is not stored

#### Scenario: Stop is idempotent

- **WHEN** a stop request is made while no engine is running
- **THEN** the response succeeds, reporting the engine as not running

#### Scenario: Stop never ends the daemon

- **WHEN** a stop request stops the engine under `spinloop daemon`
- **THEN** the daemon and its API keep running, and a later start request succeeds

#### Scenario: Metrics endpoint returns collected stats

- **WHEN** a metrics request is made
- **THEN** the response is the in-process collected metrics in the rendering-compatible stats shape

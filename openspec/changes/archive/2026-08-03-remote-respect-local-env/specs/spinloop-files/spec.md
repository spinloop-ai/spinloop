## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Spinloop file format

A Spinloop SHALL be a flat, line-oriented text file of `KEYWORD value`
instructions. The keywords are `PROVIDER`, `MODEL`, `ALIAS`, `CONTEXT`,
`OUTPUT`, `BASEURL` (also accepted as `BASE-URL`, `BASE_URL`, or `URL`),
`PRESET`, `REMOTE`, and `ENV`. Keywords SHALL match case-insensitively, with
UPPERCASE as the canonical form. Blank lines, full-line `#` comments, and
trailing comments introduced by whitespace-then-`#` SHALL be ignored. Each
instruction SHALL take exactly one value; every instruction SHALL appear at most
once, except `ENV`, which MAY be repeated. An `ENV` instruction's value SHALL be
a single `KEY=VALUE` token with a non-empty key and no whitespace. `PROVIDER` is
required. Parse errors SHALL name the offending line.

#### Scenario: A minimal Spinloop

- **WHEN** a file containing only `PROVIDER openrouter` and
  `MODEL deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` is parsed
- **THEN** it yields a selection of that provider and model

#### Scenario: Duplicate instruction

- **WHEN** a Spinloop sets `MODEL` on two lines
- **THEN** parsing fails, citing both line numbers

#### Scenario: Unknown keyword

- **WHEN** a Spinloop contains `HARNESS pi`
- **THEN** parsing fails listing the accepted keywords

#### Scenario: Missing provider

- **WHEN** a Spinloop has no `PROVIDER` instruction
- **THEN** parsing fails saying the PROVIDER instruction is missing

#### Scenario: Naming a remote endpoint

- **WHEN** a Spinloop contains `REMOTE ./remote.json`
- **THEN** it parses, and the value is available to the `remote` command group

#### Scenario: Declaring local environment variables

- **WHEN** a Spinloop contains `ENV AWS_PROFILE=dev` and `ENV AWS_REGION=eu-west-2`
  on separate lines
- **THEN** it parses, yielding both key/value pairs in the selection, and the
  repetition is not treated as a duplicate-instruction error

#### Scenario: Malformed ENV value

- **WHEN** a Spinloop contains an `ENV` instruction whose value has no `=` or an
  empty key
- **THEN** parsing fails, naming the offending line

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: API key resolution

When a provider declares an API key environment variable, the system SHALL
resolve its value from a `.env` file **beside the Spinloop being applied** first,
then from the process environment. When no Spinloop is involved — a selection made
entirely from flags — the working directory SHALL be used in its place, so a
project's own `.env` is still found. A missing key SHALL be an error when the
provider marks it required. A resolved key that does not start with the
provider's declared prefix SHALL be rejected.
Secrets SHALL never be written into a Spinloop file.

The file sits beside the Spinloop for the same reason `PRESET` and `REMOTE` do:
a Spinloop and the key it needs belong to the same project and travel together,
and a location relative to the tool cannot be resolved by an installed binary.

#### Scenario: The key travels with the Spinloop

- **WHEN** a Spinloop is applied and a `.env` beside it sets the provider's key
  variable, which is unset in the environment
- **THEN** that value is used

#### Scenario: A command with no Spinloop reads the working directory

- **WHEN** a selection made entirely from flags is applied and a `.env` in the
  working directory sets the provider's key variable
- **THEN** that value is used

#### Scenario: Another project's .env is not consulted

- **WHEN** a Spinloop is applied and the key variable is set only in a `.env`
  belonging to a different directory
- **THEN** the key does not resolve from that file

#### Scenario: Required key missing

- **WHEN** the user adds a provider whose key is required and the variable is
  set in neither `.env` nor the environment
- **THEN** the command fails naming the variable to set

#### Scenario: Malformed key

- **WHEN** the resolved key does not start with the provider's declared prefix
- **THEN** the command fails saying the key does not look right

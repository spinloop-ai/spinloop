## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Keys reach the launched agent

When spinloop launches a harness, the launched agent's environment SHALL carry the
worn Spinloop's local environment: the whole `.env` file beside that Spinloop, and
the Spinloop's own `ENV` instructions, in addition to the API key variables spinloop
can resolve for the catalogue's providers. The precedence, highest to lowest,
SHALL be the Spinloop's `ENV` instructions, then a variable already present in
spinloop's own environment, then the adjacent `.env`. An `ENV` instruction SHALL
therefore override an exported variable; the `.env` SHALL only fill a variable
that is otherwise unset. These values SHALL be placed only in the launched
agent's environment — spinloop SHALL NOT mutate its own process environment on this
path. When spinloop launches with no Spinloop worn, the whole-`.env` overlay and the
`ENV` instructions SHALL NOT be applied, though spinloop SHALL still forward the
provider keys it can resolve. Neither harness stores a secret itself — each
resolves a reference when it runs — so a key kept where only spinloop reads it still
reaches the agent. Failure to read the provider catalogue SHALL NOT prevent the
launch.

#### Scenario: A key only spinloop can see still reaches the agent

- **WHEN** spinloop can resolve a provider's key variable but it is absent from
  the environment, and the harness is launched
- **THEN** the launched agent's environment carries that variable

#### Scenario: An explicit setting is not overridden by the .env

- **WHEN** a variable is set both in spinloop's environment and in the `.env`
  beside the worn Spinloop, and the harness is launched
- **THEN** the launched agent sees the environment's value, not the `.env` value

#### Scenario: The adjacent .env fills a gap for the agent

- **WHEN** a variable is set in the `.env` beside the worn Spinloop and is unset in
  spinloop's environment, and the harness is launched
- **THEN** the launched agent's environment carries the `.env` value

#### Scenario: An ENV instruction overrides both

- **WHEN** the worn Spinloop sets a variable with an `ENV` instruction and the same
  variable is also present in spinloop's environment and/or the adjacent `.env`,
  and the harness is launched
- **THEN** the launched agent sees the `ENV` value

#### Scenario: Launching without a Spinloop applies no overlay

- **WHEN** the harness is launched with no Spinloop worn
- **THEN** spinloop applies no whole-`.env` overlay and no `ENV` instructions; the
  agent runs with spinloop's environment plus any provider key spinloop resolves

#### Scenario: An unreadable catalogue still launches the agent

- **WHEN** the provider catalogue cannot be loaded
- **THEN** the harness is launched anyway, with the environment otherwise
  unchanged

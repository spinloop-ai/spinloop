## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Remote command group

The system SHALL provide a `remote` command group with the subcommands
`bootstrap`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `deploy`, `ls`, and `stats`. `start`,
`stop`, `status`, `stats` and `deploy` each take an optional Spinloop path:
`start` SHALL boot the endpoint and block until it is serving, then perform a
quick TCP probe of the inference endpoint — if the probe fails, a warning is
printed to stderr explaining the network mismatch (see the Remote Start Probe
specification) — and finally print the base URL and API key as shell exports;
`stop` SHALL stop it immediately rather than waiting for its idle timer;
`status` SHALL report instance state and endpoint health without side effects
and SHALL NOT perform any TCP probe; `stats` SHALL report instance state,
token usage, resource consumption, and GPU information for a running instance;
`deploy` SHALL set what the endpoint serves. `ls` SHALL list the registered
remote environments (see the Remote Environments specification). `bootstrap`
SHALL stand up the shared, account-level AWS infrastructure (once per account)
by obtaining and driving the CDK project, and takes its own flags rather than
a Spinloop path (see the Endpoint Provisioning specification). An unrecognised
subcommand SHALL fail naming the accepted ones.

#### Scenario: Starting the endpoint

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote start` and the endpoint reports ready
- **THEN** the base URL and API key are printed as `export` lines

#### Scenario: Starting warns when the network is not admitted

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote start` and the endpoint reports ready
  but the TCP probe to the inference port fails
- **THEN** a warning is printed to stderr with a remediation command, and the
  command still exits 0

#### Scenario: Waiting through a cold start

- **WHEN** the endpoint reports that it is still starting
- **THEN** the command waits and retries until it is ready or the timeout
  passes, rather than failing on the first attempt

#### Scenario: Listing environments

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote ls`
- **THEN** the registered environments are listed rather than any endpoint being
  contacted

#### Scenario: Stats reports instance metrics

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote stats` with a running instance
- **THEN** token counts, resource usage, and GPU information are displayed

#### Scenario: Bootstrap is a recognised subcommand

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote bootstrap`
- **THEN** the command is dispatched to the provisioning flow rather than
  reported as unknown

#### Scenario: Unknown subcommand

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote frobnicate`
- **THEN** the command fails listing the accepted subcommands, which now
  include `bootstrap` and `stats`

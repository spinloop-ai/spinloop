## 1. Dependency and log-source plumbing

- [x] 1.1 Add `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudwatchlogs` to go.mod and tidy
- [x] 1.2 Create `internal/remote/logs.go` with a `logGroupPrefix` constant sited next to the existing `cloud-vm-llm` naming, the supported runner list, and helpers returning the engine group per runner and the boot group
- [x] 1.3 Add a test asserting the Go runner list matches the runners the deploy path already accepts, so a new engine cannot be added on one side only
- [x] 1.4 Define the `LogEvent` type (timestamp, source, instance, message, event id) and a `streamInstance` helper parsing `<env>/<instance-id>` stream names

## 2. Fetching from CloudWatch Logs

- [x] 2.1 Define the fetch interface over `FilterLogEvents` and wire a real client built from `remote.LoadAWSConfig(ctx, cfg.Region)`
- [x] 2.2 Implement paged fetch for one group: stream prefix `<env>/`, start time from the window, paging until exhausted or the in-process ceiling is hit
- [x] 2.3 Implement multi-group fetch: both engine groups for `engine`, the boot group for `boot`, both for `all`; tolerate `ResourceNotFoundException` per group and fail only when every requested group is missing
- [x] 2.4 Implement merge by timestamp with `eventId` tiebreak, `--instance` post-filter, and the trailing `--limit` cap that reports how many earlier events were omitted
- [x] 2.5 Classify the actionable failures: empty `cfg.Environment`, all groups missing, access denied, and no matching events
- [x] 2.6 Unit-test the above against a substituted fetcher — ordering, cap and omission count, instance filter, per-group not-found tolerance, all-missing error, access-denied message, empty result

## 3. The `logs` subcommand

- [x] 3.1 Create `cmd/spinloop/remote_logs.go` with `cmdRemoteLogs`, parsing `--source`, `--since`, `--limit`, `--instance`, `--follow`/`-f`, `--format` via `sortFlagsBeforeArgs`, and resolving the environment with `resolveRemoteConfig(spinloopArg(fs))`
- [x] 3.2 Validate flag values (`--source` one of engine/boot/all, `--format` one of text/json, positive `--since` and `--limit`) with messages matching the style of `remote metrics`
- [x] 3.3 Implement text rendering: oldest first, timestamp per line, source/instance prefix only when more than one source or instance is present
- [x] 3.4 Implement `--format json` emitting the structured events
- [x] 3.5 Implement the follow loop: poll from the last seen timestamp less a small overlap, suppress already-printed event ids from a bounded set, cancel on SIGINT/SIGTERM and exit nil on a cancelled context, following `runMetricsWatch`
- [x] 3.6 Add the `logs` case to `cmdRemote`, update its usage string and the unknown-subcommand error text
- [x] 3.7 Add `logs` to the remote subcommand list in `cmd/spinloop/complete.go`
- [x] 3.8 Test the command end to end with a substituted fetcher: default engine source, boot and all, labelling on and off, json output, flag validation, instance filter, and a follow loop that terminates on a cancelled context without duplicates

## 4. Documentation

- [x] 4.1 Document `spinloop remote logs` and its flags in `docs/commands/remote.md`, including the `logs:FilterLogEvents` permission the caller needs
- [x] 4.2 Update the `spinloop remote <...>` usage line in `README.md` and mention reading logs in the remote section
- [x] 4.3 Note in the docs that logs remain readable after an instance terminates, and what the "re-deploy the shared layer" error means

## 5. Verification

- [x] 5.1 `gofmt -l .` clean and `go build ./...` passes
- [x] 5.2 `go test ./... -cover` passes with coverage at or above 80%
- [x] 5.3 Manually verify against a real environment: engine logs for a running instance, boot logs, `--follow` during a start, and logs for an environment whose instance has terminated
  - Verified against a deployed account. The three log groups exist under
    exactly the derived names, and streams are named `<environment>/<instance>`
    as assumed. Engine and boot logs both read; `--source all` merges them in
    time order and labels every line once the output spans two instances;
    `--instance` narrows to one; `--format json` carries the fields; the cap
    reports what it dropped. `--follow` printed the backlog, polled for ten
    seconds without repeating a line, and exited 0 on SIGINT. An environment
    that has never logged reports the empty window and exits 0.
  - The headline case is real: an instance that no longer exists in EC2 still
    has readable engine and boot logs.
  - Not covered live: the access-denied and no-log-group messages, which would
    need credentials without log permission and an account whose shared layer
    predates log shipping. Both are covered by unit tests.
- [x] 5.4 Run `openspec validate add-remote-logs-command` and confirm the spec's scenarios are all covered by tests or the manual check

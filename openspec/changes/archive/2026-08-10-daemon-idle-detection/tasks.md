## 1. Activity tracking in the daemon (`internal/daemon`)

- [x] 1.1 Add `internal/daemon/activity.go` with an `activity` struct
  (`sync.Mutex`, `lastActive time.Time`, `lastCounter int`, `haveCounter bool`)
  and an `observe(tokens *metrics.TokenStats, now time.Time)` method
  implementing the activity rule: in-flight > 0, or a counter that differs from
  the last one; the first counter seen sets the baseline without counting as a
  change; a nil `tokens` (failed sample) changes nothing.
- [x] 1.2 Add `snapshot() (time.Time, bool)` returning the last-active time and
  whether one has ever been recorded.
- [x] 1.3 Add `markActive(now time.Time)` (moves `lastActive`, drops the
  counter baseline) for use at engine start.
- [x] 1.4 Add the fields to `Daemon` in `daemon.go`: the embedded/held
  `activity`, `SampleInterval time.Duration` (zero means
  `DefaultSampleInterval`), and `Now func() time.Time` (nil means `time.Now`),
  with a `now()` helper.
- [x] 1.5 Define `DefaultSampleInterval = 15 * time.Second`.

## 2. Sampling loop

- [x] 2.1 Add `func (d *Daemon) SampleActivity(ctx context.Context)` — a
  ticker loop following the `startProgress`/`runMetricsWatch` idiom in
  `cmd/spinloop/remote.go`: `defer ticker.Stop()`, `select` on `ctx.Done()` and
  the tick, returning cleanly on cancellation.
- [x] 2.2 Each tick: skip unless `d.Sup.Status()` reports `StateRunning` and
  the copied `d.scrape.BaseURL` is non-empty; otherwise call
  `metrics.ScrapeTokenStats` with a per-sample context and feed the result
  (including a nil on error) to `observe`.
- [x] 2.3 Copy `d.scrape` under the mutex and release before the HTTP call,
  matching the existing pattern in `Daemon.Metrics`.

## 3. Wiring activity into the existing paths

- [x] 3.1 Call `markActive` from `Daemon.StartEngine` after a successful
  `Sup.Start`, so a freshly started engine is never reported as long-idle.
- [x] 3.2 Have `Daemon.Metrics` feed its on-demand scrape through `observe`, so
  there is one place where a sample becomes activity (design D2).
- [x] 3.3 Confirm `Sup.Stop` leaves the activity record alone (no code change
  expected — assert it in a test).

## 4. Status reporting (`daemon-api`)

- [x] 4.1 Add `LastActiveAt string` (`json:"lastActiveAt,omitempty"`, RFC 3339)
  and `IdleSeconds int` (`json:"idleSeconds,omitempty"`) to `StatusResponse`.
- [x] 4.2 Populate them in `Daemon.Status()` from `snapshot()`, deriving
  `IdleSeconds` at read time; omit both when nothing has ever been recorded.
- [x] 4.3 Verify `GET /v1/status` needs no handler change (it already writes
  `d.Status()`).

## 5. Daemon lifecycle (`cmd/spinloop`)

- [x] 5.1 In `cmdDaemon` (`cmd/spinloop/serve_daemon.go`), create a
  `context.WithCancel`, start `go d.SampleActivity(ctx)` next to
  `go srv.Serve(ln)`, and cancel it in the signal-shutdown path before
  `srv.Shutdown`.
- [x] 5.2 Do the same in `runServeForegroundAPI`, so `spinloop serve --api`
  reports activity too.

## 6. Go tests

- [x] 6.1 Unit-test `observe` in `internal/daemon`: in-flight counts; counter
  moved counts; counter unchanged does not; a lower counter counts (reset);
  the first sample is a baseline; a nil sample changes nothing.
- [x] 6.2 Test `Status()` with an injected `Now`: `lastActiveAt`/`idleSeconds`
  present and growing, both absent before any engine has run, and preserved
  after the engine is stopped.
- [x] 6.3 Test `SampleActivity` against an `httptest.Server` standing in for
  the engine's `/metrics` (following `TestScrapeTokenStats`): a short
  `SampleInterval` drives several samples, activity is recorded without any API
  call, and cancelling the context ends the loop.
- [x] 6.4 Extend `TestDaemonAPI` in `daemon_test.go` to assert the new status
  fields over HTTP.
- [x] 6.5 `go test ./... -cover` — keep the total at or above 80%.

## 7. Control plane: reading the daemon's decision

- [x] 7.1 In `remote/lambda/shared/daemon.ts`, add `DaemonStatus`
  (`state`, `runner?`, `model?`, `uptimeSeconds?`, `logPath?`, `lastActiveAt?`,
  `idleSeconds?`), `DAEMON_STATUS_CMD` (curl `/v1/status` with the same
  `|| echo DAEMON_UNREACHABLE` marker), and `parseDaemonStatus`.
- [x] 7.2 In `remote/lambda/shared/idle.ts`, replace `MetricsResult` with
  `{ok: true; idleSeconds: number} | {ok: false}` and swap `metricsFromDaemon`
  for `idleFromDaemonStatus(status)`, which returns `{ok: false}` when the
  status carries no `lastActiveAt`.
- [x] 7.3 Reduce `decideIdle` to a function of durations: keep the retain
  override, max runtime and grace period in the same order, then decide `stop`
  or `wait` from the reported idle seconds. Delete `IdleState`, the `update`
  action, the counter comparison and the `last_wake_at` anchor.
- [x] 7.4 In `remote/lambda/stop/index.ts`, scrape `/v1/status` instead of
  `/v1/metrics`, drop the `readState`/`writeState` calls and the `update`
  branch, and keep the existing structured log line reporting the decision and
  reason.
- [x] 7.5 Remove the now-dead SSM state: `ensureIdleState` and `idleStateParam`
  in `remote/lambda/shared/environments.ts`, `readState`/`writeState` in
  `remote/lambda/shared/aws.ts` if nothing else calls them, the start Lambda's
  `last_wake_at` write, and the stop Lambda's `ssm:PutParameter` grant in
  `remote/lib/llm-stack.ts` if no other statement needs it.

## 8. Control-plane tests

- [x] 8.1 Rewrite the counter-driven cases in `remote/test/idle.test.ts` to
  drive `idleSeconds`: under the threshold waits, over it stops, an
  unreachable daemon stops at the threshold. The retention, max-runtime and
  grace cases carry over unchanged and must still pass.
- [x] 8.2 Extend `remote/test/stats.test.ts` (or add `daemon.test.ts`) for
  `parseDaemonStatus`: a representative reply, the unreachable marker, empty
  output, non-JSON, and a reply with no `lastActiveAt` (which must resolve to
  "no activity", not to zero idle seconds).
- [x] 8.3 Update `remote/test/stack.test.ts` for any removed IAM statement or
  parameter assertion.
- [x] 8.4 `pnpm -C remote test` and `pnpm -C remote lint` (or the repo's
  equivalent scripts) pass.

## 9. Docs and validation

- [x] 9.1 Update `docs/http-api.md`: the `GET /v1/status` field list gains
  `lastActiveAt` and `idleSeconds`, with a line on what counts as activity.
- [x] 9.2 Update `remote/docs/architecture.md`: the "Idle / stop" flowchart
  loses the counter-comparison and state-write branches and reads the daemon's
  idle time instead; drop the `idle-state` SSM node from the components
  diagram; update the key-files table.
- [x] 9.3 Update `remote/README.md`'s "Idle behaviour" section to describe
  on-instance sampling, and record the bake-then-deploy ordering.
- [x] 9.4 `gofmt -w ./...` and `go vet ./...`.
- [x] 9.5 `openspec validate daemon-idle-detection --strict`.

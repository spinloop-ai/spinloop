## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The dashboard drives the selected node

The dashboard SHALL let the operator start and stop the engine of the node
currently selected, from the keyboard, through the same node operations the one-
shot `fleet start` and `fleet stop` commands use. An action SHALL reach the
node under the cursor and no other. An action is one per node, not one per
board: while one node is starting, the operator selects another and starts it,
and the wakes run side by side. A node that already has an action in flight
SHALL take no further start or stop; the dashboard says it is still working
and drives nothing.

Start SHALL proceed without confirmation. Stop SHALL require an explicit
confirmation before it is sent, because it ends an engine that may be serving
work: a declined or abandoned confirmation SHALL send nothing.

While an action is in flight, the node's own tile SHALL carry it: the verb
and the action's status lines as the call reports them, beside the node's last
report rather than in place of it — the call's lines say what the operator
asked for, the report says what the node is doing. For a node whose last
completed refresh answered, the tile SHALL show that answer's state, what it
serves, its last-active record, and its resource usage and token and request
counters whenever the answer carries them, whatever the node's state — a boot
half done is already measuring, and that is the truth the tile keeps showing
while the call works. A node whose call reports nothing and whose refresh has
not yet answered SHALL show the verb alone, and a latest refresh that failed
SHALL change nothing on the tile. Each finished action SHALL clear the action
from its node's tile, which is then the node's report alone, and leave its
outcome on the status line, the one-shot wording.

The outcome of an action SHALL be shown inside the dashboard (a status line the
operator can read before the next refresh replaces attention), and a refused or
unreachable action SHALL NOT close the dashboard. What an action changes in state
— an engine coming up after a start, coming down after a stop — SHALL appear
through the normal refresh, without the operator asking for it.

An action in flight SHALL be abortable from the keyboard, on the node under the
cursor. A start carries no deadline — a cold cloud wake takes minutes, and a
deadline would report a failure to a slow success — so the operator's abort is
its exit: an abort SHALL end the dashboard's wait on the action, return the
node's tile to the node's report, free the node to be started or stopped again,
and show its outcome on the status line, without closing the dashboard. An abort
ends the wait, not the work it set in motion: the dashboard SHALL NOT present it
as a cancellation of the wake, and what the wake goes on to do — the node's
state — SHALL appear through the normal refresh.

#### Scenario: Starting a cold node

- **WHEN** the operator selects a node with no engine running and issues the
  start
- **THEN** the start is sent without a prompt, its outcome is shown in the
  status line, and the panel shows the node's new state as the refreshes come
  around

#### Scenario: Stopping asks first

- **WHEN** the operator issues the stop on the selected node
- **THEN** the dashboard asks for confirmation and nothing is sent
- **WHEN** the operator declines
- **THEN** the stop is not sent and the node's state is unchanged

#### Scenario: A confirmed stop is sent

- **WHEN** the operator issues the stop and confirms
- **THEN** the stop is sent to the selected node only, its outcome is shown in
  the status line, and the panel follows the node's state on subsequent refreshes

#### Scenario: A start is watched on its own tile

- **WHEN** the operator starts a node whose start reports progress as it works
- **THEN** the node's tile shows the verb and the start's status lines while
  the start is in flight
- **AND** a refresh that answers while the start is in flight shows its state
  and whatever it measures on the same tile, beneath the start's lines
- **AND** when the start finishes, the tile is the node's report alone and the
  outcome is on the status line

#### Scenario: An in-flight start before any report

- **WHEN** the operator starts a node before any refresh of it has answered
- **THEN** its tile shows the verb and the start's status lines alone
- **AND** the first answered refresh appears on the tile beside them

#### Scenario: Two nodes wake at once

- **WHEN** the operator starts one node, selects another, and starts it
- **THEN** both wakes run at the same time, each reported on its own tile
- **AND** each finishing action clears its own node and leaves its outcome on
  the status line without disturbing the other

#### Scenario: A node still starting is not started again

- **WHEN** the operator presses start on a node whose start is in flight
- **THEN** the dashboard drives nothing and says the node is still starting

#### Scenario: An in-flight start can be abandoned

- **WHEN** the operator's start on a node is still in flight — the cloud waiting
  for capacity, the boot slow, or the connection behind it dropping and
  retrying — and the operator issues the abort on that node
- **THEN** the dashboard stops waiting on the start, the node's tile returns to
  the node's report, and the outcome is shown on the status line
- **AND** the node may be started or stopped again, and the dashboard keeps
  running with its refreshes

#### Scenario: An abort is not a cancellation of the wake

- **WHEN** the operator aborts a start whose wake the cloud is already carrying
  on
- **THEN** the dashboard reports that it stopped waiting, not that the wake was
  cancelled
- **AND** the node's state, whatever the wake goes on to do, appears through the
  normal refresh

#### Scenario: An action that fails keeps the dashboard open

- **WHEN** an action is sent to a node that cannot be reached, or the node
  refuses it
- **THEN** the failure is shown in the status line with the daemon's own reason
  and the dashboard keeps running with its refreshes

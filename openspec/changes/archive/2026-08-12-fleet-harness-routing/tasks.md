## 1. The Spinloop instruction

- [x] 1.1 Add the `FLEET` keyword to `internal/spinloop`: parse it, add `Fleet` to
      `Selection`, and classify the value as a path or a URL (a scheme means a
      URL)
- [x] 1.2 Reject a Spinloop naming both `FLEET` and `REMOTE`, naming both
      instructions in the error
- [x] 1.3 Tests: a fleet path parses, a fleet URL parses as an endpoint, the
      duplicate rule still applies, `FLEET` + `REMOTE` fails, `FLEET` + `BASEURL`
      parses

## 2. The daemon reports where its engine serves

- [x] 2.1 Extract the engine-endpoint derivation from `scrapeTargetFor` in
      `cmd/spinloop/serve_daemon.go` into a helper yielding port, path prefix,
      loopback-only, and requires-key from the engine and its argv
- [x] 2.2 Add the engine endpoint to `daemon.StatusResponse`, populated from a
      hook the CLI supplies alongside `BuildArgv`, omitted when no engine runs
      and never carrying a key value
- [x] 2.3 Update `docs/openapi.yaml` and the API contract test with the new
      status fields
- [x] 2.4 Tests: a running engine reports port and flags, an idle daemon reports
      none, a gated engine reports requires-key and no key, the reported port is
      the engine's and not the API's

## 3. Fleet file: engine endpoint and engine key

- [x] 3.1 Add the optional per-node `engine:` block (host, port, path) to
      `fleet.NodeConfig`, each field falling back independently
- [x] 3.2 Add `engineTokenEnv` and resolve it exactly as the daemon token
      reference is (environment, then the `.env` beside the fleet file)
- [x] 3.3 Add the fleet-wide `prefer` key (`idle`/`active`, defaulting to
      `idle`), rejecting any other value at parse time alongside the file's
      existing validation
- [x] 3.4 Tests: a full override, a partial override, no block at all, an unset
      engine token variable naming itself, each `prefer` value, an absent one,
      and a rejected one

## 4. Selection

- [x] 4.1 Add a selector in `internal/fleet` that ranks `[]NodeResult`: running
      nodes serving the wanted model first, the activity preference deciding
      between them, fleet-file order breaking ties, non-answering nodes skipped
- [x] 4.2 Resolve the activity preference — `--prefer`, then the fleet file,
      then `idle` — and carry the reason (which preference, and the idle figures
      it compared) on the selection so callers can explain it
- [x] 4.3 Add endpoint resolution: the node's engine override, else the node's
      host with the daemon's reported port and path; refuse a loopback-only
      engine on a non-loopback node, and refuse a running node that reports no
      endpoint
- [x] 4.4 Resolve the chosen node's engine key when the node reports one is
      required, failing before anything is launched when it cannot be resolved
- [x] 4.5 Tests: the ranking rules under each preference, the precedence between
      flag, file and default, each refusal, and a whole fleet that cannot be
      reached

## 5. Waking a node

- [x] 5.1 Derive a `remote.DeployConfig` from a Selection, sharing the
      derivation with `spinloop remote deploy` rather than copying it
- [x] 5.2 Wake a candidate: push the config on `POST /v1/start`, move to the
      next candidate on a rejected config, and treat an already-running refusal
      as a re-read rather than a failure
- [x] 5.3 Wait for readiness — poll status to `running`, then probe the resolved
      engine endpoint — bounded by a package-level timeout, reporting progress
      and leaving a started engine running on timeout
- [x] 5.4 Tests against an HTTP test server: a woken node, a node that rejects
      the config, every node rejecting it, a slow engine, a timeout, and losing
      the race to another client

## 6. Routing the harness launch

- [x] 6.1 Add `--fleet`, `--node`, `--prefer`, `--no-wake` and `--wake-timeout`
      to `spinloop harness`, with `--fleet` overriding the Spinloop's `FLEET` and
      `--prefer` overriding the fleet file's
- [x] 6.2 Route before the apply, beside `fetchRemoteEnv`: select, wake if
      needed, and fill `sel.BaseURL` from the chosen node — skipping selection
      when the Spinloop pins a `BASEURL`, and saying so
- [x] 6.3 Inject `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and the node's engine key into the launched
      agent's environment without overriding what is already set, including the
      harness-specific key name lucinate reads
- [x] 6.4 Fail a `FLEET` URL with "gateway routing is not implemented yet"
- [x] 6.5 Report the chosen node, its endpoint, and the reason — naming the
      activity preference that ranked it — on stderr before launching
- [x] 6.6 Tests: routed launch, pinned node, `--no-wake` failing with the node
      table, a pinned `BASEURL` skipping selection, an exported
      `OPENAI_BASE_URL` winning, and a failed route leaving the harness config
      untouched

## 7. `spinloop fleet route`

- [x] 7.1 Add the `route` subcommand: resolve the Spinloop, fleet and preference
      as a launch does, accept `--prefer` and `--node`, report the node,
      endpoint, preference and reason, and change nothing
- [x] 7.2 Report the node a launch would wake when none is serving, without
      waking it
- [x] 7.3 Tests: an explained choice, a no-choice report, and that nothing is
      started or written

## 8. Documentation and examples

- [x] 8.1 Document `FLEET` in `docs/spinloop-file.md` and the new flags in
      `docs/commands/harness.md`
- [x] 8.2 Document `spinloop fleet route`, the `prefer` setting, the `engine:`
      block and `engineTokenEnv` in `docs/commands/fleet.md`, including when a
      fleet wants `active` rather than `idle`
- [x] 8.3 Update `examples/fleet/fleet.yaml` with a commented `prefer`, engine
      override and engine token reference
- [x] 8.4 Extend `examples/fleet-docker` to route a harness launch at a node —
      the published-port case the engine override exists for — and cover it in
      `run-tests.sh`
- [x] 8.5 Update `AGENTS.md` with the routing path and its invariants (never
      displace a running engine, never return an engine key, resolve before
      writing the config)

## 9. Verification

- [x] 9.1 `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `go test ./... -cover` at or above 80%
- [x] 9.2 `openspec validate fleet-harness-routing --strict`
- [x] 9.3 Run the `fleet-docker` example end to end: route, wake a node, launch a
      harness against it

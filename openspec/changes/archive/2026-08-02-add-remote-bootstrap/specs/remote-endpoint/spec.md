## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Remote command group

The system SHALL provide a `remote` command group with the subcommands
`bootstrap`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `deploy` and `ls`. `start`, `stop`,
`status` and `deploy` each take an optional Spinloop path: `start` SHALL boot the
endpoint and block until it is serving, printing the base URL and API key as
shell exports; `stop` SHALL stop it immediately rather than waiting for its idle
timer; `status` SHALL report instance state and endpoint health without side
effects; `deploy` SHALL set what the endpoint serves. `ls` SHALL list the
registered remote environments (see the Remote Environments specification).
`bootstrap` SHALL stand up the shared, account-level AWS infrastructure (once
per account) by obtaining and driving the CDK project, and takes its own flags
rather than a Spinloop path (see the Endpoint Provisioning specification). An unrecognised subcommand SHALL fail
naming the accepted ones.

#### Scenario: Starting the endpoint

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote start` and the endpoint reports ready
- **THEN** the base URL and API key are printed as `export` lines

#### Scenario: Waiting through a cold start

- **WHEN** the endpoint reports that it is still starting
- **THEN** the command waits and retries until it is ready or the timeout
  passes, rather than failing on the first attempt

#### Scenario: Listing environments

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote ls`
- **THEN** the registered environments are listed rather than any endpoint being
  contacted

#### Scenario: Bootstrap is a recognised subcommand

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote bootstrap`
- **THEN** the command is dispatched to the provisioning flow rather than
  reported as unknown

#### Scenario: Unknown subcommand

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote frobnicate`
- **THEN** the command fails listing the accepted subcommands, which now
  include `bootstrap`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Remote command group

The system SHALL provide a `remote` command group with the subcommands
`bootstrap`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `deploy`, `ls`, `metrics`,
and `keep`. `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `metrics` and `deploy` each
take an optional Spinloop path:
`start` SHALL boot the endpoint and block until it is serving, then perform a
quick TCP probe of the inference endpoint — if the probe fails, a warning is
printed to stderr explaining the network mismatch (see the Remote Start Probe
specification) — and finally print the base URL and API key as shell exports;
`start` SHALL also accept a `--keep DURATION` flag that sets the instance
retention deadline to `now + DURATION`, preventing the idle sweep from
terminating it before that time (see the Remote Keep specification);
`stop` SHALL stop it immediately rather than waiting for its idle timer;
`restart` SHALL stop the endpoint in the manner of a pause — without
terminating it, so its boot disk, its weights and its stable address are
preserved — and SHALL immediately start it again, blocking until it is serving
and reporting progress as `start` does (see the Reporting a start in progress
specification); `restart` SHALL accept a `--force` flag with a `-F` short form
that, when set, performs the stop without first asking the engine to shut down
(see the Endpoint Lifecycle specification for forced stops);
`status` SHALL report instance state and endpoint health without side effects
and SHALL NOT perform any TCP probe, and SHALL include the `Retain-Until`
deadline when the instance has an active retention tag;
`keep` SHALL set the `Retain-Until` tag on the environment's instance for the
given duration, without starting or stopping the instance (see the Remote Keep
specification); `metrics` SHALL report instance state, token usage, resource
consumption, and GPU information for a running instance; `deploy` SHALL set
what the endpoint serves. `ls` SHALL list the registered remote environments
(see the Remote Environments specification). `bootstrap` SHALL stand up the
account-level AWS control plane (once per account) by obtaining and driving the
CDK project, and takes its own flags rather than a Spinloop path (see the
Endpoint Provisioning specification). An unrecognised subcommand SHALL fail
naming the accepted ones.

#### Scenario: Starting the endpoint

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote start` and the endpoint reports ready
- **THEN** the base URL and API key are printed as `export` lines

#### Scenario: Starting warns when the network is not admitted

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote start` and the endpoint reports ready
  but the TCP probe to the inference port fails
- **THEN** a warning is printed to stderr with a remediation command, and the
  command still exits 0

#### Scenario: Starting with a keep flag

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote start --keep 4h` and the endpoint reports ready
- **THEN** the base URL and API key are printed as `export` lines, and the
  instance retention deadline is set to 4 hours from now

#### Scenario: Waiting through a cold start

- **WHEN** the endpoint reports that it is still starting
- **THEN** the command waits and retries until it is ready or the timeout
  passes, rather than failing on the first attempt

#### Scenario: Restarting the endpoint

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote restart` for a running environment and
  the endpoint reports ready again
- **THEN** the instance was stopped and re-woken without being terminated, the
  command blocked until the model was serving again, and the environment's
  address is the one its configuration records

#### Scenario: Forcing a restart skips the engine stop

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote restart --force` (or `-F`)
- **THEN** the instance is stopped without the engine being asked to shut down
  first, and the command then blocks until the model is serving again

#### Scenario: Restarting a stopped endpoint starts it

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote restart` for an environment whose instance is already stopped
- **THEN** the instance is re-woken rather than replaced, and the command blocks
  until the model is serving again, as with a plain start

#### Scenario: A failed re-wake says how to recover

- **WHEN** the stop half of a restart has taken effect but the wake fails
- **THEN** the command fails saying the instance is stopped and that
  `spinloop remote start` will bring it back

#### Scenario: Listing environments

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote ls`
- **THEN** the registered environments are listed rather than any endpoint being
  contacted

#### Scenario: Setting a keep deadline

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote keep 2h`
- **THEN** the instance retention tag is set and the deadline is reported

#### Scenario: Metrics reports instance figures

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics` with a running instance
- **THEN** token counts, resource usage, and GPU information are displayed

#### Scenario: Bootstrap is a recognised subcommand

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote bootstrap`
- **THEN** the command is dispatched to the provisioning flow rather than
  reported as unknown

#### Scenario: Unknown subcommand

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote frobnicate`
- **THEN** the command fails listing the accepted subcommands, which include
  `bootstrap`, `metrics`, and `keep`

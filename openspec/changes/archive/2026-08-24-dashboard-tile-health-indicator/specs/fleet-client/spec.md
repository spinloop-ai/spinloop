## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard panels show a health indicator

Each panel SHALL show a coloured status glyph alongside its node's name,
distinct from the border colour that marks the selected panel, so a node's
health reads at a glance across a grid of many panels without reading each
panel's text. The glyph SHALL be shown in every panel shape: a settled
answer, an action in flight, a panel awaiting its first refresh, and a panel
showing a failed outcome.

A node's health SHALL fall into exactly one of four tiers, coloured green,
yellow, red, and grey respectively:

- **Healthy**: the node answered its last refresh, its engine is not
  crashed, and — when the daemon reports readiness for it — the engine is
  ready. A `running` node whose daemon reports no readiness (an older
  daemon, or a runner with no known health check) counts as healthy too,
  rather than reporting a health tier the daemon cannot actually back.
- **Attention**: the node has a start or stop action in flight for it, or is
  `running` with its daemon explicitly reporting the engine not yet ready.
- **Unhealthy**: the node's engine has crashed, or its last refresh's
  outcome was a failure (`unreachable`, `unauthorized`, `config-error`,
  `failed`, or `unsupported`).
- **Unknown**: no status can be determined for the node — it has not yet
  answered any refresh, or its last refresh answered without reporting an
  engine state.

#### Scenario: A running, ready node reads healthy

- **WHEN** a node's last completed refresh reports its engine `running` and
  its daemon reports the engine ready
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is green

#### Scenario: A running node still loading reads attention

- **WHEN** a node's last completed refresh reports its engine `running` and
  its daemon reports the engine not yet ready
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is yellow, even though its engine state
  reads `running`

#### Scenario: A running node with no readiness signal reads healthy

- **WHEN** a node's last completed refresh reports its engine `running` and
  its daemon reports no readiness for it
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is green, the same as before this
  daemon-side signal existed

#### Scenario: A crashed node reads unhealthy

- **WHEN** a node's last completed refresh reports its engine `crashed`
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is red

#### Scenario: An unreachable node reads unhealthy

- **WHEN** a node's last refresh could not reach its daemon
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is red, alongside the outcome and reason
  already shown

#### Scenario: A node awaiting its first refresh reads unknown

- **WHEN** the dashboard opens and a node has not yet answered any refresh
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is grey, until its first refresh lands

#### Scenario: An answer without a state reads unknown

- **WHEN** a node's last refresh answered but reported no engine state
- **THEN** its panel's status glyph is grey

#### Scenario: An action in flight reads attention

- **WHEN** the operator starts or stops a node and that action has not yet
  finished
- **THEN** that node's panel's status glyph is yellow while the action is in
  flight, whatever the node's last completed refresh reported

#### Scenario: The glyph is distinct from the selection border

- **WHEN** the operator moves the selection onto a panel
- **THEN** the selected panel's border colour changes as it does today, and
  every panel's status glyph colour is unaffected by which panel is selected

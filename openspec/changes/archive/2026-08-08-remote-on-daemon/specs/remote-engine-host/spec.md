## Purpose

Define how the remote GPU instance hosts its engine through spinloop's own
daemon: spinloop baked into the runtime AMI, boot handing the daemon a deploy
config and running it on loopback, the control Lambdas speaking to that
daemon over SSM, and the engine's log and self-healing riding on the daemon's
contract — one engine host, cloud and local alike.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Spinloop is baked into the runtime AMI

The runtime AMIs for both runners SHALL include a pinned spinloop release,
installed at image-bake time with its version declared alongside the other
pinned runner versions. Changing the pinned version SHALL produce a new image
version, so an instance's spinloop is decided by its AMI, not fetched at boot.

#### Scenario: Instance boots with spinloop present

- **WHEN** an instance launches from a runtime AMI
- **THEN** the spinloop binary is already installed and runnable without network
  access

### Requirement: The instance engine runs under the daemon

At boot the instance SHALL run `spinloop daemon` as its engine host, bound to
loopback, instead of a per-runner engine unit. The boot sequence SHALL derive
the daemon's deploy config from the environment's stored deploy config — with
the cloud-owned settings (bind address and port, API-key delivery, the synced
local weights path) resolved into it — place it where the daemon reads it,
and request the engine's start through the control API once the daemon
answers, so the boot start is the same explicit API start any client
performs. The engine command the daemon runs SHALL be equivalent to the one
the boot script previously installed for that runner.

#### Scenario: Boot starts the engine through the daemon

- **WHEN** an instance boots for an environment whose deploy config names a
  runner and model
- **THEN** the daemon starts that engine serving the synced weights, and the
  endpoint answers on the instance's serving port as before

#### Scenario: The control API is loopback-only

- **WHEN** the daemon's control API is listening on the instance
- **THEN** it is bound to loopback, unreachable from the network, and needs no
  bearer token

### Requirement: Control Lambdas read the daemon

The stats path SHALL obtain engine and system metrics by calling the
on-instance daemon's metrics endpoint over SSM, merging in what only the
control plane knows (environment, instance id and type, uptime), and SHALL
preserve the reply shape `spinloop remote metrics` renders today. The idle
check SHALL read its activity signals (in-flight requests, cumulative
counters) from the same daemon reply. The control plane SHALL NOT collect
metrics by running per-metric shell commands on the instance.

#### Scenario: Stats flow through the daemon

- **WHEN** `spinloop remote metrics` runs against a running instance
- **THEN** the reported state, GPU, CPU, RAM and token figures come from the
  daemon's metrics endpoint and render in the existing bar, table and JSON
  formats unchanged

#### Scenario: Idle detection uses the daemon's counters

- **WHEN** the idle check runs against a running instance
- **THEN** it decides from the daemon-reported in-flight and cumulative token
  counters, and a server whose daemon is unreachable is treated as showing no
  activity

### Requirement: Crash recovery is preserved

The instance SHALL restart a crashed engine automatically: a boot-installed
check SHALL ask the daemon's status periodically and request a start when the
engine is `crashed`. The daemon itself remains restart-free; the recovery
loop is instance plumbing.

#### Scenario: Crashed engine comes back

- **WHEN** the engine process on the instance dies unexpectedly
- **THEN** within the check interval the engine is started again without human
  intervention

### Requirement: Engine logs keep shipping

The engine's output SHALL continue to reach its CloudWatch log group and stay
size-bounded on disk, sourced from the daemon's engine log file at its stable
path. The boot log's shipping is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Engine log reaches CloudWatch via the daemon's file

- **WHEN** the engine writes output while running under the daemon
- **THEN** those lines appear in the engine's CloudWatch log stream

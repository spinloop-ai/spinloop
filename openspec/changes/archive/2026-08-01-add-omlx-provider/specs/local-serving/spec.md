## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Choosing the engine

`spinloop serve` SHALL launch the inference engine the Spinloop's `PROVIDER` names,
the local counterpart of the runner `spinloop remote deploy` selects from the same
instruction. `llamacpp` SHALL run `llama-server`; `omlx` SHALL run the oMLX CLI.
There SHALL be no default: a `PROVIDER` that is not a self-hosted engine SHALL
fail, naming the providers that can be served, rather than launching an engine
the Spinloop did not ask for.

An engine whose executable is normally installed outside the `PATH` SHALL also be
looked for at its conventional install location, so a user who has never put it
on their `PATH` can still serve.

#### Scenario: Provider selects the engine

- **WHEN** the Spinloop says `PROVIDER omlx`
- **THEN** the printed command runs the oMLX CLI, not `llama-server`

#### Scenario: A provider that is not a local engine

- **WHEN** the Spinloop names a hosted provider such as `ollama` or `openrouter`
- **THEN** the command fails, listing the providers that can be served locally

#### Scenario: Engine installed outside the PATH

- **WHEN** the oMLX CLI is not on the `PATH` but is present in its macOS app
  bundle
- **THEN** `serve` uses the bundled executable

### Requirement: Serving a multi-model engine

An engine that loads a directory of models and selects one per request SHALL be
servable with neither a `PRESET` nor a `MODEL`, since it needs nothing at launch
to know what to load. For such an engine the Spinloop's `MODEL` and `ALIAS` SHALL
keep their usual meaning — the id the harness requests — rather than becoming
launch flags, and `CONTEXT` SHALL size the harness's window only. `BASEURL`'s
host and port SHALL still set the server's bind address, and SHALL be omitted
entirely when the Spinloop states no `BASEURL`, so the engine's own defaults stand.

#### Scenario: Bare Spinloop starts the server

- **WHEN** the Spinloop states only `PROVIDER omlx`
- **THEN** the server is launched with no bind flags and no model flags, rather
  than failing for want of a model

#### Scenario: Bind address from BASEURL

- **WHEN** the Spinloop adds `BASEURL http://127.0.0.1:9100/v1`
- **THEN** the command binds the server to that host and port

### Requirement: Secrets never reach the server command

`serve` SHALL NOT resolve or pass an API key to the engine it launches. Because
the command is printed before it runs, and an engine may accept its key as a
command-line flag, passing one would expose the secret on screen and to any local
process. Configuring authentication on the server is the engine's own concern.

#### Scenario: A set key is not passed through

- **WHEN** the provider's API key variable is set in the environment
- **THEN** neither the printed command nor the launched process carries the key

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Serve basics

`spinloop serve [path]` SHALL read a Spinloop (default `./Spinloop`, aliases and
directories accepted like every Spinloop command), build the command for the
engine its `PROVIDER` names, print it in copy-pasteable shell form, and run it
with stdio forwarded. `--dry-run`/`-n` SHALL print the command without
launching. A missing binary SHALL produce an install hint naming **that** engine
rather than a raw exec error.

#### Scenario: Dry run

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop serve --dry-run`
- **THEN** the resolved command is printed and no server starts

#### Scenario: Engine not installed

- **WHEN** the selected engine's binary cannot be found
- **THEN** the error suggests installing that engine, not another one

### Requirement: Preset-based serving

With a `PRESET`, the referenced `.ini` SHALL supply the command: a relative
preset path resolves against the Spinloop's own directory, so the pair can travel
together. The preset's `[*]`/`[global]` section holds shared defaults; each named
section is one model whose keys are server arguments with dashes stripped. The
served section is chosen by the Spinloop's `ALIAS`, matched case-insensitively; a
preset with exactly one section is always served; no sections is an error;
several sections with no matching name SHALL fail listing the available
sections. Values the Spinloop itself states SHALL override the preset's.

A preset SHALL be read in the flag vocabulary of the engine the `PROVIDER` names,
never in a vocabulary inferred from the file. A preset written for one engine is
therefore not portable to another: read in the wrong vocabulary it would parse
cleanly and produce a command with silently rewritten or dropped flags.

#### Scenario: Spinloop overrides the preset

- **WHEN** the preset section sets `ctx-size = 4096` and the Spinloop says
  `CONTEXT 32768`
- **THEN** the command carries a context size of 32768

#### Scenario: Ambiguous preset

- **WHEN** the preset defines several sections and the Spinloop's `ALIAS` matches
  none
- **THEN** the command fails listing the section names to choose from

#### Scenario: Another engine's preset keys are left alone

- **WHEN** an oMLX preset contains a key that llama.cpp would treat as a short
  alias
- **THEN** the key is rendered as written, not rewritten to llama.cpp's
  long-form flag

### Requirement: Flag rendering

Preset keys SHALL render as the engine's flags. Where an engine defines short
aliases, they SHALL be canonicalised to their long form so the same flag written
different ways collapses to one when layers merge, later layers overriding
earlier ones in place; an engine that defines none SHALL pass its keys through
unchanged. Flags the engine accepts bare SHALL render bare when truthy and be
dropped when falsy (`0`, `false`, `off`, `no`). Printed commands SHALL quote only
the tokens that need it, and SHALL pass values to the server verbatim.

#### Scenario: Layer override by canonical name

- **WHEN** the global section sets `c = 4096` and the model section sets
  `ctx-size = 8192` for llama.cpp
- **THEN** the command carries a single context-size flag with value 8192

#### Scenario: Boolean flags

- **WHEN** a llama.cpp preset sets `jinja = 1` and `mmap = 0`
- **THEN** the command includes a bare `--jinja` and no mmap flag

#### Scenario: An engine with no short aliases

- **WHEN** an oMLX preset sets `model-dir` and `memory-guard`
- **THEN** both render as their long-form flags with their values unchanged

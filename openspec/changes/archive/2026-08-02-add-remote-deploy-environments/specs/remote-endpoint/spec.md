## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deploying what the endpoint serves

`spinloop remote deploy` SHALL derive the deployment from the Spinloop and its
preset: `PROVIDER` SHALL select the inference engine, `MODEL` or the preset's
Hugging Face reference SHALL name the weights as a repository and optional
quantisation, `CONTEXT` or the preset's context size SHALL set the window,
`ALIAS` SHALL set the name the endpoint serves under (defaulting to the
repository), and the preset's remaining settings SHALL become the engine's
arguments. Settings the endpoint owns — host, port, model location, API key,
context size, alias, and metrics — SHALL be dropped, so one preset can both
serve locally and deploy unchanged. The request SHALL describe only what to
serve, never where the weights are stored. A `--dry-run` SHALL print the
derived deployment without sending it.

Deploy SHALL target a named environment: in addition to deriving what to serve,
it SHALL create and register that environment on the shared layer (its Elastic
IP, instance configuration, per-environment API key and ingress, and SSM state),
as defined by the Environment Deployment specification. Deploying SHALL NOT start
the instance.

#### Scenario: A preset drives both serving and deploying

- **WHEN** a Spinloop with a preset is deployed
- **THEN** the engine's arguments are the preset's, minus the settings the
  endpoint sets itself

#### Scenario: The Spinloop overrides its preset

- **WHEN** the Spinloop states a `MODEL` and `CONTEXT` that differ from the
  preset's
- **THEN** the Spinloop's values are deployed

#### Scenario: A provider that is not a self-hosted engine

- **WHEN** a Spinloop naming a hosted provider is deployed
- **THEN** the command fails saying that only a self-hosted engine can be
  deployed

#### Scenario: A local model file

- **WHEN** a Spinloop naming a local model file is deployed
- **THEN** the command fails saying to name a repository instead, because the
  endpoint fetches its own weights

#### Scenario: Deploying creates and registers the environment

- **WHEN** a deployment succeeds against a bootstrapped account
- **THEN** the named environment is created and registered in the registry, and
  the report says whether the weights still have to be fetched before it can
  serve

#### Scenario: Deploying is not starting

- **WHEN** a deployment succeeds
- **THEN** the environment is configured but not started, and the report says
  whether the weights still have to be fetched before it can serve

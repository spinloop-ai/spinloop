## Why

A node currently decides two things about its own engine that the client is
better placed to decide, and the split shows up as behaviour nobody would
choose deliberately.

**The engine's key comes from whichever end happens to supply it.** A daemon
started from its own Spinloop gates its engine with whatever that machine's
preset says; a node woken by routing gets no key at all, because the derivation
drops `api-key` — so a preset that says "gate this engine" is silently ignored.
Meanwhile the client, which needs the key to hand to the agent, learns it from
a third place: `engineTokenEnv` in its own `fleet.yaml`. Two ends hold the same
secret independently and nothing reconciles them, so a mismatch surfaces as a
401 on the agent's first request.

**A node holds workload configuration it has no business holding.** `spinloop
daemon` resolves a Spinloop (and its preset, and `SPINLOOP_ALIAS`) so it can serve
something without being asked. Nothing in production uses this: the cloud runs
`spinloop daemon --api-addr 127.0.0.1:4242` with no path and is driven entirely by
pushed configs. What it does produce is confusion — a node's Spinloop and a
client's Spinloop are different documents with different jobs, and the fleet
examples had to grow a paragraph explaining why they cannot be the same file.

The remote path already resolved both of these: the control plane holds the key,
tells the instance what to run, and hands the key to the caller. This makes a
fleet node work the same way, with the client in the control plane's seat.

## What Changes

- **A start request carries the engine's API key.** `POST /v1/start` accepts one
  alongside the deploy config, and the daemon starts the engine gated with it.
  The client already holds the node's bearer token, so it is already trusted to
  run arbitrary engine commands there; supplying a key is strictly less than
  that.
- The daemon SHALL write the key to a file and pass `--api-key-file`, never
  `--api-key`, so the secret is not visible in `ps` to every local user. This is
  how the cloud already delivers it.
- Routing supplies the key on the implicit start too, so a woken node is gated
  exactly as an explicitly started one is. The client knows the key it just set,
  so it hands that to the launched agent rather than resolving one separately.
- `engineTokenEnv` stops meaning "the key the node was gated with, told to you
  out of band" and starts meaning "where the client looks up the key it will
  set" — the same field, now purely client-side, and the seam for resolving keys
  from something better than an environment variable later.
- **`spinloop daemon` becomes a worker: it reads no Spinloop and no preset**, and
  takes no Spinloop path. It serves what a start request carries or what was
  pushed and stored, and a start with neither fails saying so. **BREAKING**:
  `spinloop daemon ./Spinloop` and `SPINLOOP_ALIAS`-driven daemons stop working.
- It reads no `fleet.yaml` either. That file is the *client's* map of the fleet;
  a node has no use for its peers' addresses, and handing every node the map
  widens what one compromised node exposes.
- **The control-API bearer token gains two more sources**: `--api-token-file`
  and `--api-token`, beside the existing `SPINLOOP_API_TOKEN`. The daemon no
  longer loads a Spinloop's `.env`, so the environment alone would leave a
  hand-started LAN daemon with nowhere convenient to put it. See "Two
  credentials, two rules" below for why a literal flag is allowed here and
  refused for the engine's key.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `engine-credentials`: where an engine's API key comes from, how it reaches
  the engine without being exposed, and what the daemon will and will not say
  about it.

### Modified Capabilities
- `daemon-api`: the start request carries an engine key; the bearer token may
  come from a file or a flag as well as the environment.
- `serve-daemon`: the daemon takes no Spinloop path and resolves no Spinloop or
  preset; what it serves comes from the request or the stored config alone.
- `fleet-routing`: the requirement that resolved a key the node was already
  gated with is replaced by one where the wake supplies the key it will hand to
  the agent — the direction reverses, so it is a replacement rather than an
  edit.
- `fleet-config`: `engineTokenEnv` is the client's lookup for the key it sets.

## Impact

- `internal/daemon`: start accepts a key; the key is written 0600 and passed as
  `--api-key-file`; token resolution gains the file and flag forms.
- `cmd/spinloop`: `daemon` loses its Spinloop path and its Spinloop/preset
  resolution, and gains `--api-token`/`--api-token-file`; the routing wake sends
  the key it resolved.
- `internal/fleet`: the wake pushes a key; `engineKeyFor` becomes "resolve the
  key to set" rather than "resolve the key the node needs".
- `docs/openapi.yaml`, `docs/commands/{fleet,serve}.md`, `docs/env-vars.md`, and
  both fleet examples — `examples/fleet-local` currently documents starting the
  daemon beside a Spinloop, and `examples/fleet-docker` ships a `node/Spinloop` and
  a `CMD` that passes it.
- **Depends on `fleet-harness-routing`** landing first: this modifies
  `fleet-routing` and `fleet-config`, which that change introduces.

### Two credentials, two rules

`daemon-api` currently states the token is supplied via the environment "never
as a command-line flag", because a command line is readable by any local user
through `ps`. This change keeps that reasoning for the *engine's* key — which is
why it insists on `--api-key-file` — and narrows it for the daemon's own token,
which is a different kind of secret: configured locally, by whoever runs the
daemon, on a machine they have already decided to trust with it, rather than set
remotely by a client and left on the node.

So the blanket rule becomes a reasoned one, and the three sources are peers.
`--api-token-file` is what the documentation names for a service manager, since
a literal there would sit in a unit file *and* in the process list; the `ps`
exposure is stated with the command rather than argued in the flag's own help.

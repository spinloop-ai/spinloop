# Bar Metrics Format Specification

## Purpose

Define the bar graph output format for `spinloop remote metrics` with colour-coded resource utilization indicators.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Bar format output

The system SHALL support a `--format=bar` option that renders resource metrics as horizontal progress bars. Each bar SHALL consist of a left-aligned label, a filled portion using block characters, an unfilled portion using light shade characters, and a right-aligned percentage value.

#### Scenario: Bar format displays CPU utilization

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics --format=bar` with a running instance that has CPU data
- **THEN** the output includes a bar labelled "CPU" with filled and unfilled segments proportional to the utilization percentage

#### Scenario: Bar format displays RAM utilization

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics --format=bar` with a running instance that has memory data
- **THEN** the output includes a bar labelled "RAM" with filled and unfilled segments proportional to the used/total memory ratio

#### Scenario: Bar format displays GPU utilization

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics --format=bar` with a running instance that has GPU data
- **THEN** the output includes bars labelled "GPU util" and "GPU mem" (or "GPU N util"/"GPU N mem" for multiple GPUs) with filled and unfilled segments proportional to their respective utilization

#### Scenario: Bar format header line

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics --format=bar` with a running instance
- **THEN** the first line shows the environment, state, instance type, and model ID separated by double spaces

### Requirement: Colour thresholds

The bar fill SHALL be colour-coded based on utilization: green for values at or below 80%, yellow for values from 80% to 90%, and red for values above 90%. The colour SHALL be reset after the filled portion so the unfilled characters and percentage appear in the terminal's default colour.

#### Scenario: Green bar for low utilization

- **WHEN** a metric value is 70%
- **THEN** the bar fill appears in green

#### Scenario: Yellow bar for high utilization

- **WHEN** a metric value is 85%
- **THEN** the bar fill appears in yellow

#### Scenario: Red bar for critical utilization

- **WHEN** a metric value is 95%
- **THEN** the bar fill appears in red

### Requirement: Bar format is default

The system SHALL use bar format as the default output when no `--format` flag is specified.

#### Scenario: Default format is bar

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics` without `--format`
- **THEN** the output is in bar format

### Requirement: Bar format with stopped instance

When the instance is not running, bar format SHALL show the header line with environment, state, instance type, and model — but SHALL NOT display resource bars.

#### Scenario: Stopped instance shows header only

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop remote metrics --format=bar` and the instance is stopped
- **THEN** the output shows the header with state "stopped" and no resource bars

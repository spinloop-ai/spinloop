## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Engine stats collection

The system SHALL collect token and request statistics from a running engine by
querying the engine's own metrics endpoint over HTTP on the engine's serving
address. The collected statistics SHALL include the prompt and generated token
counts as the engine exposes them, and the engine's cumulative request count
where the engine exposes one. A request count the engine's metrics do not
expose SHALL be absent from the collected statistics rather than reported as
zero: every stat is optional by design, and a figure no source produced is not
a zero. When the engine requires API-key authentication for its metrics
endpoint, the collector SHALL authenticate with the key the engine was
started with.

The serving address SHALL be the one the engine was actually told to bind:
when the engine's command states a host or port, those SHALL determine where
the collector looks, in preference to any address configured elsewhere or
compiled in as that engine's default. An engine started on a non-default port
is the ordinary case, not an exception — a deployment that describes what to
serve without stating a base URL still binds wherever its arguments say.

A bind naming every interface SHALL be read as loopback for collection
purposes. Collection is always to an engine on the same host, and a wildcard
is not an address to dial.

Where the engine's command states no address at all, the collector SHALL fall
back to a configured base URL, and failing that to the engine's default.

#### Scenario: Running engine yields token stats

- **WHEN** metrics are collected while a supervised engine is running and
  serving requests
- **THEN** the result includes the engine's prompt token and generated token
  counts, and its request count where the engine's metrics expose one

#### Scenario: An engine without a request counter omits the figure

- **WHEN** metrics are collected from an engine whose metrics expose no
  cumulative request count
- **THEN** the result omits the request count rather than reporting zero, and
  the figures the engine does expose are present

#### Scenario: The engine's own arguments locate it

- **WHEN** an engine is started on a port other than its default, and no base
  URL is configured
- **THEN** the collector queries the port the engine was given, not the
  engine's default

#### Scenario: A wildcard bind is collected over loopback

- **WHEN** an engine is started bound to every interface
- **THEN** the collector queries it on loopback

#### Scenario: Unreachable engine does not fail collection

- **WHEN** metrics are collected and the engine's metrics endpoint cannot be
  reached
- **THEN** the result omits engine stats, reports the rest, and the collection
  as a whole does not error

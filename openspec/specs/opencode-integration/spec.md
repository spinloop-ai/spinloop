# opencode Integration Specification

## Purpose

Define how `spinloop` reads and writes opencode's global config: which file it
targets, the in-place JSONC merge that preserves everything the user already
has, default-model handling, secret handling, and the state read back for
`show` and `export`.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Config file resolution

The opencode adapter SHALL target the config under
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/opencode`, preferring an existing
`opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc` (in that order) so a competing file is
never left alongside one the user already has, and falling back to creating
`opencode.json`.

#### Scenario: Existing JSONC file is reused

- **WHEN** the user has only `opencode.jsonc` and runs `spinloop add`
- **THEN** that file is updated and no `opencode.json` is created

### Requirement: In-place JSONC merge

Writes SHALL parse the existing config as JSONC — tolerating comments and
trailing commas — and apply edits so that comments and formatting outside the
managed provider block are preserved. The parent `provider` object SHALL only
be created when absent, so sibling providers are never clobbered. The managed
provider block SHALL be deep-merged over any existing block of the same id, so
user-added extras inside it survive. A `$schema` reference SHALL be added when
none exists. Applying the same selection twice SHALL be idempotent.

#### Scenario: Comments survive

- **WHEN** the config holds comments and an unrelated provider, and the user
  runs `spinloop add`
- **THEN** after the write the comments and the unrelated provider are intact

#### Scenario: User extras inside the managed block survive

- **WHEN** the user has hand-added a setting inside the managed provider's
  block and re-runs the same `spinloop add`
- **THEN** the setting is still there afterwards

#### Scenario: Idempotent apply

- **WHEN** the same selection is applied twice
- **THEN** the second write leaves the file byte-for-byte unchanged

### Requirement: Default model handling

Applying a selection with a chosen model SHALL set opencode's top-level `model`
to `<providerId>/<modelKey>`. Removing SHALL clear the top-level `model` when
it pointed at a removed model or a removed provider's models, and SHALL leave
it alone otherwise.

#### Scenario: Default cleared on removal

- **WHEN** the default model points at a model being removed
- **THEN** the top-level `model` key is removed too

#### Scenario: Unrelated default survives removal

- **WHEN** the default model points at a provider not being touched
- **THEN** the top-level `model` key is unchanged

### Requirement: Secrets and file permissions

The API key SHALL be written to the provider block's options as an
environment-variable reference in opencode's `{env:VAR}` form, naming the
provider's key variable — never the resolved secret, so no secret is written to
disk. The reference SHALL be written even when the variable is currently unset,
because opencode substitutes it when it reads the config, so the key may be set
after the Spinloop is applied. The option SHALL be omitted entirely when the
provider declares no key variable, or when its key variable is declared
optional and the provider's endpoint is a local address — a local server needs
no key, and naming a variable nobody will set would only mislead.

The config SHALL still be written with owner-only (`0600`) permissions —
enforced even when the file already existed with looser ones — since it names
the user's providers and endpoints.

#### Scenario: The key is referenced, not embedded

- **WHEN** a provider with an API key variable is applied
- **THEN** the config's `apiKey` is that variable's `{env:VAR}` reference, and
  the resolved secret appears nowhere in the file

#### Scenario: A key set after applying still works

- **WHEN** a Spinloop is applied with the key variable unset, and the variable is
  set before opencode runs
- **THEN** opencode resolves the reference to that value

#### Scenario: A local keyless server gets no key option

- **WHEN** a provider whose key is optional is applied against a local base URL
  with its key variable unset
- **THEN** the provider block carries no `apiKey` option

#### Scenario: Permissions enforced on existing file

- **WHEN** the config file exists with permissive mode and `spinloop add` writes
  it
- **THEN** the file's mode is owner-only afterwards

### Requirement: State read-back

The adapter SHALL read back each configured provider — its model keys
(sorted), `options.baseURL`, and each model's `limit.context`/`limit.output`
when set — plus the top-level default model. This state SHALL be sufficient
for `spinloop show` and `spinloop export` to reconstruct what is configured.

#### Scenario: Export sees what add wrote

- **WHEN** a selection with context and output limits has been applied
- **THEN** the read-back state reports those limits for each written model

# Model Discovery Specification

## Purpose

Define live, per-provider model discovery: fetching the models a provider
currently serves from its own OpenAI-compatible `/models` endpoint, the
best-effort and quiet failure behaviour that keeps it from ever breaking a
command, in-process caching, and how discovered models surface through
`spinloop list --models` and shell completion.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Per-provider model discovery

The system SHALL be able to fetch the set of models a provider currently serves from that
provider's own OpenAI-compatible endpoint with `GET {baseURL}/models`, reading model ids
from the returned `data[].id` list and returning them in stable order. This covers every
discoverable provider — OpenRouter, vLLM, llama.cpp, the generic `openai-compatible`
endpoint, and Ollama (whose compatibility layer serves `/v1/models`).

The base URL SHALL be resolved with the same precedence a selection uses (`--base-url`,
then `SPINLOOP_BASE_URL`, then the provider's catalogue value, then its Pi endpoint). A
provider with no resolvable base URL (for example AWS Bedrock) is not discoverable. When
the provider declares an API key variable and it resolves to a value, that value SHALL be
sent as the request's `Authorization` header; a resolved key SHALL NOT be written to disk
or logged.

#### Scenario: A provider lists the models it serves

- **WHEN** discovery runs for a provider whose endpoint answers `GET {baseURL}/models`
  with a `data` array of objects carrying `id`
- **THEN** those ids are returned, in stable order, as the provider's discovered models

#### Scenario: A provider with no endpoint is not discoverable

- **WHEN** discovery runs for a provider with no resolvable base URL (such as AWS Bedrock)
- **THEN** discovery reports the provider is not discoverable and returns no models

#### Scenario: The resolved key is only sent, never stored

- **WHEN** discovery queries a provider whose key resolves from the environment
- **THEN** the key is sent as an `Authorization` header and never written to any file or log

### Requirement: Discovery is best-effort and quiet

Model discovery SHALL be best-effort. A network failure, a non-success HTTP status, a
timeout, a missing required key, or an unparseable response SHALL yield an empty model set
rather than an error, and SHALL NOT prevent the surrounding command from succeeding.
Discovery SHALL apply a bounded request timeout so a slow or unreachable endpoint cannot
hang a command.

#### Scenario: Offline discovery does not fail the command

- **WHEN** `spinloop list --models <provider>` runs and the provider's endpoint is
  unreachable
- **THEN** the command still prints the provider's plumbing, reports no models were found,
  and exits successfully

#### Scenario: A slow endpoint cannot hang the command

- **WHEN** a provider's endpoint does not respond within the discovery timeout
- **THEN** discovery abandons the request and returns no models

#### Scenario: Completion stays silent on discovery failure

- **WHEN** model completion sources from discovery and the endpoint errors
- **THEN** `__complete` offers no model candidates, exits zero, and writes nothing to
  stderr

### Requirement: Discovery result caching

Within a single process, discovery SHALL cache a provider's result for a short time-to-live
so that repeated lookups (for example, listing then completing) do not re-hit the network.
A cache entry SHALL be keyed by the resolved provider endpoint.

#### Scenario: Repeated lookups reuse the cached result

- **WHEN** discovery for the same provider endpoint is requested twice within the TTL
- **THEN** the second lookup returns the cached models without a second network request

### Requirement: Surfacing discovered models

`spinloop list --models <provider>` SHALL print the provider's discovered models beneath its
plumbing. Without `--models`, `spinloop list` SHALL behave as before (plumbing only) and
SHALL NOT perform any network request. Shell model completion SHALL offer discovered models
for a provider that supports discovery, scoped to the `--provider` already on the line.

#### Scenario: Listing a provider's live models

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop list --models openrouter` and discovery succeeds
- **THEN** the provider's currently-served model ids are printed under its entry

#### Scenario: Plain list makes no network call

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop list` with no `--models` flag
- **THEN** no discovery request is made and only provider plumbing is printed

#### Scenario: Model completion offers discovered ids

- **WHEN** the user completes `spinloop add -p openrouter -m <TAB>` and discovery succeeds
- **THEN** the provider's discovered model ids are offered as candidates

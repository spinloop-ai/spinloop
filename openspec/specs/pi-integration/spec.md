# Pi Integration Specification

## Purpose

Define how `spinloop` reads and writes the Pi coding agent's model catalogue at
`~/.pi/agent/models.json`: the merge that preserves everything else in the
file, Pi's API-key idiom, which providers are Pi-capable, and the differences
from opencode (no default-model setting).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Config location and shape

The Pi adapter SHALL write `~/.pi/agent/models.json` — resolved from the home
directory, not XDG — as plain JSON of the form
`{"providers": {"<id>": {baseUrl, api, apiKey, models: [...]}}}`. A missing
file SHALL be treated as an empty document, and the directory SHALL be created
when needed. The file SHALL be written with owner-only (`0600`) permissions.

#### Scenario: First write creates the file

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop add -H pi` and no `models.json` exists
- **THEN** the file is created with the managed provider entry and owner-only
  permissions

### Requirement: Preserving merge

Writes SHALL merge only the managed provider entry: unknown top-level keys,
sibling providers, and unknown fields on the managed provider (headers,
compat, model overrides, …) SHALL all round-trip untouched. The provider's
scalar fields (`baseUrl`, `api`, `apiKey`) are overwritten when set; the
`models` arrays are unioned by `id` with incoming entries winning, and written
sorted by id so the file is deterministic.

#### Scenario: Sibling provider and unknown fields survive

- **WHEN** `models.json` holds another provider and extra fields on the managed
  one, and the user re-runs `spinloop add -H pi`
- **THEN** the sibling provider and the extra fields are intact afterwards

#### Scenario: Models unioned by id

- **WHEN** the managed provider already lists a model the selection also names
- **THEN** the incoming entry replaces it and no duplicate id appears

### Requirement: API key idiom

The managed provider's `apiKey` SHALL be written as a `$ENV_VAR` interpolation
referencing the provider's key variable — never the resolved secret. The
reference SHALL be written even when that variable is currently unset, because
Pi resolves it when it runs, so the key may be exported after the Spinloop is
applied.

A dummy literal placeholder SHALL be written instead when the provider has no
key variable at all, or when its key variable is declared optional, resolves to
nothing, AND the provider's endpoint is a local address — because Pi hides a
provider's models from `/model` until some auth is configured, and for a local
server, which ignores the value, a reference to a variable set nowhere would
leave them hidden. The placeholder SHALL NOT be written for a non-local
endpoint, since Pi resolves the reference when it runs and a placeholder could
not then be repaired by setting the variable.

#### Scenario: Keyed provider references the variable

- **WHEN** an OpenRouter selection is applied to Pi
- **THEN** the entry's `apiKey` is the literal string `$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`-style
  reference, not the key's value

#### Scenario: Keyless provider gets a placeholder

- **WHEN** an Ollama or llama.cpp selection is applied to Pi
- **THEN** the entry's `apiKey` is a dummy literal so the models are selectable
  in `/model`

#### Scenario: An optional key that is set is referenced

- **WHEN** a provider whose key is optional is applied to Pi with its key
  variable set
- **THEN** the entry's `apiKey` is the `$ENV_VAR` reference, so the remote
  endpoint is authenticated

#### Scenario: An optional key at a remote endpoint keeps its reference

- **WHEN** a provider whose key is optional is applied to Pi against a non-local
  base URL, with its key variable unset
- **THEN** the entry's `apiKey` is the `$ENV_VAR` reference, so setting the
  variable before running Pi is enough

#### Scenario: A required key survives being unset at apply time

- **WHEN** a provider whose key is not optional is applied to Pi with its key
  variable unset
- **THEN** the entry's `apiKey` is still the `$ENV_VAR` reference, so exporting
  the key later is enough

### Requirement: Pi capability gating

A provider SHALL be usable with the Pi harness only when the catalogue gives it
a `pi` block (declaring the protocol `api` and optionally a Pi-specific base
URL). Selecting an unsupported provider under Pi SHALL fail saying the provider
is not supported by the pi harness.

The Pi base URL SHALL resolve as: explicit override, then the provider's own
`optionsFromEnv` endpoint variable, then the `pi` block's `baseUrl`, then the
provider's `options.baseURL`. A per-provider endpoint variable SHALL therefore
apply to both harnesses, not only opencode: it states where the user's server
is, which is not a property of the config format being written.

Because the resolved endpoint decides whether a keyless local server is being
addressed, dropping that variable would also mis-classify a remote endpoint as
local and write the keyless placeholder in place of the key reference.

#### Scenario: Bedrock is opencode-only

- **WHEN** the user selects a provider with no `pi` block under Pi
- **THEN** the command fails explaining the provider has no Pi support

#### Scenario: Per-provider endpoint variable reaches Pi

- **WHEN** a provider's endpoint variable names a remote host and the selection
  is applied under Pi
- **THEN** the written entry carries that host, and a provider with a key
  variable carries the key reference rather than the keyless placeholder

#### Scenario: An explicit override still wins

- **WHEN** both the generic base-URL override and the provider's own endpoint
  variable are set
- **THEN** the override is written

### Requirement: Required options under Pi

A Pi provider entry carries only a base URL, a protocol, a key, and models, so a
provider declaring required options has nowhere to put them. Building a Pi
provider whose required options do not resolve SHALL fail, naming the variable
to set, rather than writing an entry silently missing them.

The embedded catalogue SHALL NOT pair required options with a `pi` block, since
such a provider cannot be served by Pi at all; the runtime check exists for
catalogues supplied at run time, which no integrity test can inspect.

#### Scenario: A required option is unset

- **WHEN** a Pi-capable provider declares a required option and nothing supplies
  it
- **THEN** the command fails naming the environment variable that would satisfy it

### Requirement: No default model on Pi

Pi has no default-model setting, so applying a selection SHALL NOT record one;
instead the command SHALL tell the user which model to select with `/model`
inside Pi. `spinloop export` for Pi SHALL rely on the provider selection alone.

#### Scenario: Add tells the user what to pick

- **WHEN** a selection with a chosen model is applied to Pi
- **THEN** the output notes that Pi has no default-model setting and names the
  model to pick with `/model`

### Requirement: Per-model limits

When the selection carries a context window and output limit, they SHALL be
written on every model the selection adds, as `contextWindow` and `maxTokens`.

#### Scenario: Limits land on the Pi models

- **WHEN** `spinloop add -H pi -p llamacpp -m my-model -c 128k` is applied
- **THEN** the written model has `contextWindow` 128000 and `maxTokens` 32000

# Local Serving Specification

## Purpose

Define `spinloop serve`: launching `llama-server` for the model a Spinloop
describes — from the Spinloop's own instructions, or from a llama.cpp preset
`.ini` it points at — so the same file that configures the harness can also start
the server behind it. `serve` is harness-agnostic and never touches harness
config.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Serve basics

`spinloop serve [path]` SHALL read a Spinloop (default `./Spinloop`, aliases and
directories accepted like every Spinloop command), build the command for the
engine its `PROVIDER` names, print it in copy-pasteable shell form, and run it
with stdio forwarded. `--dry-run`/`-n` SHALL print the command without
launching. A missing binary SHALL produce an install hint naming **that** engine
rather than a raw exec error.

#### Scenario: Dry run

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop serve --dry-run`
- **THEN** the resolved command is printed and no server starts

#### Scenario: Engine not installed

- **WHEN** the selected engine's binary cannot be found
- **THEN** the error suggests installing that engine, not another one

### Requirement: Choosing the engine

`spinloop serve` SHALL launch the inference engine the Spinloop's `PROVIDER` names,
the local counterpart of the runner `spinloop remote deploy` selects from the same
instruction. `llamacpp` SHALL run `llama-server`; `omlx` SHALL run the oMLX CLI;
`vllm` SHALL run `vllm serve`, with the model passed as its positional
argument, the served name as `--served-model-name`, and the context window as
`--max-model-len`. There SHALL be no default: a `PROVIDER` that is not a
self-hosted engine SHALL fail, naming the providers that can be served, rather
than launching an engine the Spinloop did not ask for.

An engine whose executable is normally installed outside the `PATH` SHALL also be
looked for at its conventional install location, so a user who has never put it
on their `PATH` can still serve.

#### Scenario: Provider selects the engine

- **WHEN** the Spinloop says `PROVIDER omlx`
- **THEN** the printed command runs the oMLX CLI, not `llama-server`

#### Scenario: vLLM is servable

- **WHEN** the Spinloop says `PROVIDER vllm` with a `MODEL`
- **THEN** the printed command runs `vllm serve` with that model as the
  positional argument

#### Scenario: A provider that is not a local engine

- **WHEN** the Spinloop names a hosted provider such as `ollama` or `openrouter`
- **THEN** the command fails, listing the providers that can be served locally

#### Scenario: Engine installed outside the PATH

- **WHEN** the oMLX CLI is not on the `PATH` but is present in its macOS app
  bundle
- **THEN** `serve` uses the bundled executable

### Requirement: Preset-less serving

Without a `PRESET`, the Spinloop SHALL supply the command directly and MUST name
a `MODEL`: a value that looks like a local file (ending `.gguf`, or starting
with `/`, `./`, `../`, or `~`) becomes the model path, anything else is
treated as a Hugging Face repo reference. `ALIAS` sets the served model's
reported name, `CONTEXT` (parsed with the standard lenient size format) sets
the context size, and `BASEURL`'s host and port set the server's bind address.

#### Scenario: Hugging Face repo

- **WHEN** the Spinloop has `MODEL unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`,
  `ALIAS qwen3.6`, and `CONTEXT 32768`
- **THEN** the command carries the repo reference, the alias, and a context
  size of 32768

#### Scenario: Local file

- **WHEN** the Spinloop has `MODEL ./models/qwen.gguf`
- **THEN** the command loads that file as a model path rather than a repo

#### Scenario: No model to serve

- **WHEN** the Spinloop has neither `PRESET` nor `MODEL`
- **THEN** the command fails explaining serve needs one of them

### Requirement: Serving a multi-model engine

An engine that loads a directory of models and selects one per request SHALL be
servable with neither a `PRESET` nor a `MODEL`, since it needs nothing at launch
to know what to load. For such an engine the Spinloop's `MODEL` and `ALIAS` SHALL
keep their usual meaning — the id the harness requests — rather than becoming
launch flags, and `CONTEXT` SHALL size the harness's window only. `BASEURL`'s
host and port SHALL still set the server's bind address, and SHALL be omitted
entirely when the Spinloop states no `BASEURL`, so the engine's own defaults stand.

#### Scenario: Bare Spinloop starts the server

- **WHEN** the Spinloop states only `PROVIDER omlx`
- **THEN** the server is launched with no bind flags and no model flags, rather
  than failing for want of a model

#### Scenario: Bind address from BASEURL

- **WHEN** the Spinloop adds `BASEURL http://127.0.0.1:9100/v1`
- **THEN** the command binds the server to that host and port

### Requirement: Preset-based serving

With a `PRESET`, the referenced `.ini` SHALL supply the command: a relative
preset reference resolves against the Spinloop's own source — a local directory
join when the Spinloop was read from disk, URL-relative resolution when the
Spinloop was fetched from a URL — so the pair can travel together either way. A
`PRESET` MAY itself be an absolute `http://`/`https://` URL regardless of
where the Spinloop lives, in which case it is fetched over HTTP. Fetching a
remote `PRESET` SHALL happen only when a command that consumes it (`spinloop
serve`, `spinloop remote deploy`) actually builds its launch or deploy
configuration — never merely because the Spinloop was read or applied. The
preset's `[*]`/`[global]` section holds shared defaults; each named section is
one model whose keys are server arguments with dashes stripped. The served
section is chosen by the Spinloop's `ALIAS`, matched case-insensitively; a
preset with exactly one section is always served; no sections is an error;
several sections with no matching name SHALL fail listing the available
sections. Values the Spinloop itself states SHALL override the preset's.

A preset SHALL be read in the flag vocabulary of the engine the `PROVIDER`
names, never in a vocabulary inferred from the file. A preset written for one
engine is therefore not portable to another: read in the wrong vocabulary it
would parse cleanly and produce a command with silently rewritten or dropped
flags.

#### Scenario: Spinloop overrides the preset

- **WHEN** the preset section sets `ctx-size = 4096` and the Spinloop says
  `CONTEXT 32768`
- **THEN** the command carries a context size of 32768

#### Scenario: Ambiguous preset

- **WHEN** the preset defines several sections and the Spinloop's `ALIAS` matches
  none
- **THEN** the command fails listing the section names to choose from

#### Scenario: Another engine's preset keys are left alone

- **WHEN** an oMLX preset contains a key that llama.cpp would treat as a short
  alias
- **THEN** the key is rendered as written, not rewritten to llama.cpp's
  long-form flag

#### Scenario: A remote preset

- **WHEN** the Spinloop sets `PRESET https://example.com/preset.ini`
- **THEN** `spinloop serve` fetches that URL and serves the section its `ALIAS`
  selects

#### Scenario: A preset relative to a URL-sourced Spinloop

- **WHEN** a Spinloop fetched from `https://example.com/team/Spinloop` sets
  `PRESET ./preset.ini`
- **THEN** `spinloop serve` fetches `https://example.com/team/preset.ini`

#### Scenario: A preset is not fetched by commands that do not need it

- **WHEN** `spinloop apply` runs against a Spinloop whose `PRESET` is a URL
- **THEN** the preset URL is never fetched, matching how a local `PRESET` is
  already ignored by `apply`

### Requirement: Flag rendering

Preset keys SHALL render as the engine's flags. Where an engine defines short
aliases, they SHALL be canonicalised to their long form so the same flag written
different ways collapses to one when layers merge, later layers overriding
earlier ones in place; an engine that defines none SHALL pass its keys through
unchanged. Flags the engine accepts bare SHALL render bare when truthy and be
dropped when falsy (`0`, `false`, `off`, `no`). Printed commands SHALL quote only
the tokens that need it, and SHALL pass values to the server verbatim.

#### Scenario: Layer override by canonical name

- **WHEN** the global section sets `c = 4096` and the model section sets
  `ctx-size = 8192` for llama.cpp
- **THEN** the command carries a single context-size flag with value 8192

#### Scenario: Boolean flags

- **WHEN** a llama.cpp preset sets `jinja = 1` and `mmap = 0`
- **THEN** the command includes a bare `--jinja` and no mmap flag

#### Scenario: An engine with no short aliases

- **WHEN** an oMLX preset sets `model-dir` and `memory-guard`
- **THEN** both render as their long-form flags with their values unchanged

### Requirement: Parallelism

`CONTEXT` SHALL always mean the context window a single request gets, whatever
engine serves it. A Spinloop's `PARALLEL` SHALL set the number of concurrent
request slots, translated per engine so that `CONTEXT`'s meaning holds:

- For `llamacpp`, `PARALLEL n` SHALL be rendered as `--parallel n`. Because
  llama.cpp treats `--ctx-size` as a total budget divided across its parallel
  slots, when the Spinloop **also** states `CONTEXT`, the rendered `--ctx-size`
  SHALL be `context_tokens * n` rather than `context_tokens`, so each slot
  still gets the context the Spinloop asked for. `CONTEXT` set with no
  `PARALLEL` SHALL render `--ctx-size` as `context_tokens`, unscaled, exactly
  as before this capability existed.
- For `vllm`, `PARALLEL n` SHALL be rendered as `--max-num-seqs n`.
  `--max-model-len` (from `CONTEXT`) SHALL NOT be scaled by `PARALLEL`: vLLM's
  concurrency is bounded independently of a single request's context length.
- For `omlx`, `PARALLEL n` SHALL be rendered as `--max-concurrent-requests n`.
  oMLX has no context flag to scale either way.

A Spinloop stating no `PARALLEL` SHALL produce a command identical to one from
before this capability existed, for all three engines. A `PARALLEL` value
SHALL be validated as a positive integer at the point it is used (`serve`, a
daemon-pushed config, or `remote deploy`); a value that is not SHALL fail
naming the invalid value rather than being passed to the engine.

When `CONTEXT` is supplied by a `PRESET` section's own `ctx-size` rather than
by the Spinloop, `PARALLEL` SHALL NOT rescale it — only a Spinloop-stated
`CONTEXT` participates in the `llamacpp` multiply. A `PARALLEL` value SHALL
still override a preset's own `np`/`parallel` (llama.cpp), `max-num-seqs`
(vLLM), or `max-concurrent-requests` (oMLX) value by the same
override-by-canonical-name rule `CONTEXT` already uses against a preset's
`ctx-size`.

#### Scenario: llama.cpp context is scaled by parallel slots

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER llamacpp`, `CONTEXT 128k`, and
  `PARALLEL 2`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--ctx-size 256000` and `--parallel 2`

#### Scenario: llama.cpp parallel with no context set

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER llamacpp` and `PARALLEL 4` with no
  `CONTEXT`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--parallel 4` and no `--ctx-size`
  flag is added

#### Scenario: llama.cpp context with no parallel set is unscaled

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER llamacpp` and `CONTEXT 128k` with no
  `PARALLEL`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--ctx-size 128000`, exactly as it
  would have before `PARALLEL` existed

#### Scenario: A preset's own context is not rescaled

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER llamacpp`, `PARALLEL 2`, and a `PRESET`
  whose section sets `ctx-size` but the Spinloop itself states no `CONTEXT`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--parallel 2` and the preset's
  `ctx-size` value passes through unscaled

#### Scenario: vLLM concurrency does not touch context

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER vllm`, `CONTEXT 128k`, and `PARALLEL 4`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--max-model-len 128000` and
  `--max-num-seqs 4`, with neither value derived from the other

#### Scenario: oMLX concurrency

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER omlx` and `PARALLEL 8`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--max-concurrent-requests 8` and no
  context flag, exactly as with no `PARALLEL` stated

#### Scenario: No PARALLEL means no change

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states no `PARALLEL`, for any of the three engines
- **THEN** the printed command is identical to what it would have been before
  this capability existed

#### Scenario: Invalid parallel count

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PARALLEL 0`, a negative number, or a non-numeric
  value, for any of the three engines
- **THEN** the command fails naming the invalid value rather than passing it
  to the engine

#### Scenario: Spinloop PARALLEL overrides a preset's own value

- **WHEN** a Spinloop states `PROVIDER llamacpp` and `PARALLEL 2`, and its
  `PRESET` section separately sets `np = 4`
- **THEN** the printed command includes `--parallel 2`, not `--parallel 4`

### Requirement: Secrets never reach the server command

`serve` SHALL NOT resolve or pass an API key to the engine it launches. Because
the command is printed before it runs, and an engine may accept its key as a
command-line flag, passing one would expose the secret on screen and to any local
process. Configuring authentication on the server is the engine's own concern.

#### Scenario: A set key is not passed through

- **WHEN** the provider's API key variable is set in the environment
- **THEN** neither the printed command nor the launched process carries the key

### Requirement: Control API flag

`spinloop serve` SHALL accept `-a`/`--api` to expose the control API over the
foreground engine, as defined by the `daemon-api` capability. Serve SHALL
remain a foreground command with no daemon flag — long-lived supervision is
`spinloop daemon`'s job. Without `--api`, serve's foreground stdio-forwarded
behaviour SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: Plain serve is unchanged

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop serve` without `--api`
- **THEN** the engine runs in the foreground with stdio forwarded, exactly as
  before

#### Scenario: Serve with the API stays foreground

- **WHEN** the user runs `spinloop serve -a`
- **THEN** the engine runs in the foreground with the control API listening
  beside it
